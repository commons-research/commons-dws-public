Mostly the references was particularly challenging (poor quality).\nAn unit test checked the code after each changes for the same results.</p>\n<p>Step 3 - Dissemination:<br>\nThe researchdata should be accessible following the FAIR principles.

Think of it as a cache for everything that you care about - if you've spent more then five minutes solving a problem, you should never spent any more time solving the same exact problem.\n> \n> Dendron is a knowledge base built by and for developers and integrates natively with IDEs like VS Code and VSCodium.\n\n#### Where to get more info on Dendron ?\n\n- You can get more information in the Dendron system at the official website www.dendron.so\n- All the Dendron documentation is hosted here https://wiki.dendron.so/. It is, obviously, a Dendron itself.\n\n#### Concrete steps to access and contribute to the DBGI Dendron\n\n1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\n2. Install [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) from the VSCode marketplace \n3. Clone the COMMONS Dendron repo\n\n    In your terminal\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/commons-research/commons-dws-public.git\n    ```\n4. In VSCode open (File/Open) the cloned repository.\n5. Voila ! You should now be in the COMMONS Lab Open Dendron.\n\nFeel free to explore and contribute.\nA first, important step could be to configure VSCode so that you can easily add a daily note. See steps described at [[open-notebook.commons.setup]]\n\n\n## Questions, comments, suggestions ?\n\nFeel free to contribute here https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/discussions\n\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.112.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/commons-dws-public","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://commons-research.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"COMMONS DWS Public","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Click here to edit this page on Github !","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"edit","editRepository":"https://github.com/commons-research/commons-dws-public"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root","searchMode":"lookup"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
