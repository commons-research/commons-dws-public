Great experience regarding the advancement of taxon / taxonomic treatments handling.</p>\n<p>This part (current credit attribution and authorship methods could also be discussed and guidelines proposed ?\nI have done some bibliography on this for another project. What looked like the fairest way and simplest is the one proposed by \"The first author takes it all? Solutions for crediting authors more visibly, transparently, and free of bias\" <a href=\"https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12569\">https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12569</a> and others. Basically alphabetical ordering of the authors + two clear CRediT tables (one by tasks done, one by authors) looks random enough (should be stated explicitely) and explain who has been doing what. The idea is to break the first/last author monopoly which is not the best way to credit authors contrib. A colleague told me that we shouldn't / coulnt do this with PhD, MSc students because they NEED their first author paper. Im happy to hear your thought here. This small app makes it easy to implement such tables. (In a paper like this one it's maybe overkill as their is not much more than writing involved ...) They also suggest everyone should let their email and be corresponding authors.\nYou put me wherever you want, as long as it helps the people in fields where author positions matter. </p>\n<p>See this vbiewpoint as suggestion to ediotrs.\nFor ex. adoption of the CREDIT for authors in NP journals </p>\n<p>*3.

A brief description of the review and topic to be covered, including:</p>\n<pre><code>This synopsis aims to provide an overview of the emerging field of open science in natural products research, highlighting its significance, key principles, and potential impact on the field. Natural products have long been a valuable source of compounds with diverse biological activities, contributing to the development of novel drugs, foods and dyes; and form the basis of the traditional medicine used by the vast majority of the world's population. However, the traditionally closed and proprietary nature of natural products research has limited and still hinders the accessibility, reproducibility, and collaboration within the scientific community. The concept of open science promotes transparency, accessibility, and collaboration through the unrestricted sharing of research outputs, data, and methodologies. In this review, we will explore the various aspects of open science in the context of natural products research, including open access publishing, open data, open source software, citizen science initiatives, and collaborative networks. We will discuss the benefits, challenges, and potential solutions associated with adopting an open approach in natural products chemistry, emphasizing the potential for accelerating scientific discovery, fostering innovation, and promoting global collaboration in this vital field. Additionally, we will present novel guidelines for publishing and documenting natural products occurrences, with the aim of proposing standardized practices that could be readily adopted by researchers and publishers in the field. By establishing clear and comprehensive guidelines, we seek to enhance the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) of natural products research, ultimately fostering a more open and collaborative scientific ecosystem.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Implications for the wider scientific community:</p>\n<p>The adoption of open science in natural products research promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. It enhances the reproducibility and reliability of research, accelerates knowledge dissemination, and facilitates the development of NP's applications. It also fosters inclusivity and global collaboration within the scientific community, ultimately advancing the field and benefiting society as a whole. However the transition to open research requires sustained efforts and resources, and these are best mobilized when the benefits of open science are clearly identified by the researchers. Currently, funding agencies are progressively enforcing research outputs, processes and methodologies to be open, making such global transition inevitable in the end. In addition, open science helps people from less privileged places to both learn from and join in on advanced research, breaking down the usual barriers. For individuals outside the institutions of science and industry, it makes complex knowledge easier to access, understand and use, leading to better decisions and creative solutions for problems in their own communities and the wider world.</p>\n<p>Communities the article will appeal to:</p>\n<p>natural products chemists, pharmacologists, medicinal chemists, organic chemists, biochemists, ecologists, cheminformaticians and researchers interested in open science and description of the global chemodiversity.\nIt is also relevant to professionals in academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and those involved in the dissemination of knowledge, including librarians, publishers, and policymakers.</p>\n<p>We therefore aim to address an entire ecosystem, from Knowledge Producers to Knowledge Disseminators in Natural Products Research, as we strongly believe that communities need to act together to improve the health of the whole natural products ecosystem, and that Open Science provides the necessary path and opportunity for strengthening this collaboration in going forward.</p>\n<p>*6. Suggested section headings</p>\n<pre><code>1.  Overview of Natural Products Research from antiquity to nowadays\n2. Emergence and current landscape of Open Natural Products Research\n3. Key Principles of Open Science in the Context of Natural Products Research\n4. The Significance of Open Science in Advancing Natural Products Research\n5. Proposed solutions for Publishing and Documenting Natural Products\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we will notably propose a semantically-enriched version of the current viewpoint, a semantically-enriched version of a typical NPR hot-off-the-press (e.g. <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/np/d3np90029k\">https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/np/d3np90029k</a>) and propose to editors a simpler and easy to adopt mechanism for the enhancement of Natural Products Research dissemination (a CSV file to be shared in Supplementary Information, or as a Zenodo repository associated to the published paper). </p>\n<p>*7.
