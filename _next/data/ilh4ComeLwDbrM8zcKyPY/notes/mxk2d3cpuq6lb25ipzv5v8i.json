Because of the interference of the extractives in polysaccharide and lignin analysis, procedures for elucidation of the chemical composition of bark begin with an extraction protocol that consists\nof sequential extraction solvents of increasing polarity. A common protocol begins with a diethyl ether extraction step that yields waxes, fatty acids, fats, resin acids, phytosterols, and terpenes. This is followed by an ethyl alcohol extraction step that yields condensed tannins, flavonoids, and phenolics. The third step uses hot water, and yields condensed tannins and water-soluble carbohydrates. To release phenolic acids, hemicelluloses, and suberin monomers from the residue from the third step, 1% aqueous sodium hydroxide is used (Holloway and Deas 1973, Kolattukudy 1984). The extract fractions from the above-mentioned steps are then subjected to further workup to separate each into easy-to-analyze mixtures of compounds. For example, partitioning the diethyl ether fraction against aqueous sodium bicarbonate separates the fatty acids and resin acids from the neutral components, tannins, terpenes, and flavonoids. The neutral fraction is then\nsaponified to give the alcohols and salts of fatty acids, dicarboxylic, hydroxy-fatty, and ferulic acids. Ethanol extraction followed by hot water extraction of the insoluble ether fraction yields soluble simple sugars and condensed tannins. Sodium hydroxide extraction of the insoluble residue gives soluble suberin monomers, phenolic acids, and hemicelluloses. Sulfuric acid treatment of the insoluble fraction yields lignin (Chang and Mitchell 1955, Hemingway 1981, Laks 1991).</li>\n<li>Why no use of MS ?

the the COMMONS Lab Open Dendron !\n\nIn the [COMMONS Lab](https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/groups/allard/) we intent to follow the [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) approach to document our research.\n\nFor this we use the [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) system as a mean to efficiently capture notes and publish them.\n\n## What is this note\n\nThis note is a succinct tutorial note aiming to get you started in the use of the COMMONS Lab Dendron.\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Dendron. \n\n#### What is Dendron ?\n\n> Dendron is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool. Think of it as a cache for everything that you care about - if you've spent more then five minutes solving a problem, you should never spent any more time solving the same exact problem.\n> \n> Dendron is a knowledge base built by and for developers and integrates natively with IDEs like VS Code and VSCodium.\n\n#### Where to get more info on Dendron ?\n\n- You can get more information in the Dendron system at the official website www.dendron.so\n- All the Dendron documentation is hosted here https://wiki.dendron.so/. It is, obviously, a Dendron itself.\n\n#### Concrete steps to access and contribute to the DBGI Dendron\n\n1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\n2. Install [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) from the VSCode marketplace \n3. Clone the COMMONS Dendron repo\n\n    In your terminal\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/commons-research/commons-dws-public.git\n    ```\n4. In VSCode open (File/Open) the cloned repository.\n5. Voila ! You should now be in the COMMONS Lab Open Dendron.\n\nFeel free to explore and contribute.\nA first, important step could be to configure VSCode so that you can easily add a daily note.
