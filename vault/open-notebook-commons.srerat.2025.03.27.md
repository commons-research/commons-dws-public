## Doing

## Paused

## Done
Continued with the collect. It took me 2 hours to almost completely sample 2 trees. By following this logic, I have around 138 hours (18 office days=>6 weeks if 3 days a week) of collect to fit in the semester.
It appears working late and during the week-end isn't an option anymore.

Some python.
Sticking the legend of the signs on the nitrogen box might be a good way to avoid having a flying sheet in the collect bag.

## Notes

## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never
