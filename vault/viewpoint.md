Initial invitation email

> Dear Pierre-Marie,
> 
> I hope you are doing well,
> 
> Since a number of years, I have been on the editorial board of Natural Product Reports.
> I saw the nice website of your group (https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/groups/allard/), and this made me think: might you be interested in writing a Viewpoint (together with any relevant co-authors) on open science in natural products research?
> 
> If you are enthusiastic, the next step would be to prepare a synopsis (see attachments for instructions), which I would then circulate among the editorial board for suggestions and approval.
> 
> I am looking forward to hearing what you think!

Yesterday answered to the NPR editor.
> 
> Many thanks for your email and invitation.
> 
> I am pretty much interested in your suggestion as I believe writing and proposing ressources and perspectives on the topic of Open Science is of interest in most disciplines.
> I would be happy to propose such Viewpoint for the field of NP research.
> 
> I have already some possible coauthors in mind and have discussed with some.
> They are willing to participate but everyone is (like always nowadays) somehow underwater.
> What would be the delays (if any) to hand over this Viewpoint ?
> 
> Second point would it be possible to have it published in Open Access (it would indeed be ironical to have such article paywalled)


His answer

> Great to hear back from you. And fantastic to hear that you are enthusiastic about contributing something on this topic.
> 
> Yes, submitting the synopsis somewhat later is no problem. When do you think you can send it in?
> 
> And sure, NPR has several open access options: https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/npr/
> RSC also made many deals with many universities and countries, through which authors do not have to pay open access fees themselves: https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/open-access-publishing/read-and-publish/deals/
> It looks like your university is included in such a deal, but best to check with your library to make sure.
