# Python
To get start with python is very easy. But to come back to a project and let it run again can hurt.
This should be a small introduction how to handle python environements.  

It is important for the following steps, to have now activated environments. For example if you using conda (you can see it in the terminal - (base) ), then you should deactivate it. Maybe in the past you had some troubles... It can be a good idea to clean the base in conda.

Conda deactivate:           `conda deactivate`  
Conda actiavate (base):     `conda activate`  
Conda clean (base):         `conda clean --all`  

For checking, which pyhton version is in use:   `which python`  

## Python versions
As we all, also Python is developping. Some packages are developped for the newest python and a specific time
but not updated for the newest python versions. This can be a problem when you want to use this package, but you just installed the newest version.  

The solution is to use a virtual environment (for example [__conda__](https://anaconda.org/), [__pipenv__](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), ect.).  

In this case we will have a look for **pyenv** (the easier way to work with python versions).  

### Pyenv

#### Installation
To install [__pyenv__](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) you can use the automatic installer (tested with Ubuntu):  
`curl https://pyenv.run | bash`  

After that you have to add the following lines to your `vim ~/.bashrc` fileend:
```bash
#Pyenv loader
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Load pyenv-virtualenv automatically
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

```   

To take this changes into effect you have to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`. Now it is ready to go.


#### Useful commands
| **command**            	| **description**                                                                                 	|
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `pyenv install --list` 	| all possible python versions to install.                                                        	|
| `pyenv install <version>` | install the choosen <version> from --list. This can take a while...                             	|
|    `pyenv versions`    	| shows all installed environments and the active one                                             	|
|         `pyenv`        	| help site                                                                                       	|
|  `pyenv global <system>` 	| Don't use this, if you not sure what you are doing. We will use poetry for the python versions. 	|
|  `pyenv local <system>` 	| If poetry can't find your version. Use this to load the rigth version and the use poetry.      	|



### Poetry
Poetry takes care of the python versions and the packages. All this is handled in a single *.toml file.
Changes can be done in this file, but mainly it is recommended to use the terminal.

#### Installation
Pip is the package manager for python. For poetry it is recommended to install it with pipx, which takes care of the packages globaly.  
1. Install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

2. install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       `poetry install`       	   | Takes the *.toml file and installs all the packages. Creates the poetry.lock file.	|
|         `poetry init`        	   | This folder will set up to use a virtual environement with poetry. 	            |
|  `poetry new <projectname>`  	   | Makes the folder with the files in it.                             	            |
| `poetry add <pythonpackage>` 	   | Add a package to your project.                                     	            |   
|       `poetry update`       	   | For added packages, it is recommended to update them after that.     	            |
| `poetry env use <pythonversion>` | Change python version.                            	                                |
|  `poetry run <python script.py>` | Run your code in poetry.                                            	            |



`poetry install` is the same as `poetry update` if there's no *poetry.lock* file. It's only slightly more convenient to install directly from the *poetry.lock* file if you don't want to update dependencies. `poetry lock` creates a *poetry.lock* file, but does not install packages.
It can be useful in groupworks, that the poetry.lock stays "unchanged". So all collaborators are sure, it works with the defined packages.
