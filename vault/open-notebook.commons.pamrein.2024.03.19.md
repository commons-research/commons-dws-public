# PAMREIN's daily Open Notebook (COMMONS Lab)

## Todo - [Check Github](https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/projects/2/views/1)
-[] todays goal is to finish the prog and show it to mary-pierre...


## Meetings
- short look at the prog


## Daily report (What did I learn?)
polar used sphinx for the documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>.


df_remove = []
    ...: for i in range(len(df1)):
    ...:     for j in range(len(df)):
    ...:         print(df1[i,:].equals(df[j,:]))
    ...:         if df1[i,:].equals(df[j,:]):
    ...:             df_remove.append(df1.row(i))
    ...:             break;

I am still not done with the programming part. The problem is one basic step and I just don't find a solution...
One solution could be change to pandas, but I like to do it with polars.
