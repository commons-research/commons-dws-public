## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Today I will try to finish my prog. 

For better programming, I tried to install spyder and use it with poetry. 
I run in the problem, that spyder would have a problem to install dependencies on poetry with the command `poetry add spyder`. 

`dir(<package>)` : all the possible attribute and methods.

I still tried out the same stuff like yesterday. 
The function *.join() should do what I like to have. But I will get still some unusual results.
for example, if I do a subset of a dataframe and join it with *inner*, I will get nothing.
The return should be the same dataframe.
