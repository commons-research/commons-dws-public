# Guidelines for submitting a synopsis to Natural Product Reports

NPR articles are designed to give an interesting insight into the topic, focussing on the key developments that have shaped a field rather than giving a very comprehensive overview of all results. Authors are encouraged to include their own perspective on developments, trends and future directions.
Before commissioning articles for NPR we ask that authors provide a brief synopsis. This is circulated to members of the editorial board for comment.  

Please include the following information in your synopsis:

1. A proposed title for the work


2. Authors and affiliations (including co-authors if known)

[[viewpoint.authors]]

3. A suggested length of the article – this should be the number of printed journal pages

8 pages

4. The time span of the literature you intend to cover

Among the oldest and most important medical papyri of Ancient Egypt, it was purchased at Luxor in the winter of 1873–1874 by the German Egyptologist Georg Ebers. It is currently kept at the Leipzig University Library in Germany.") to nowadays.
