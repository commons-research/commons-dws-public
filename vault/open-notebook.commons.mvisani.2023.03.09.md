### Buidling a data practice from scratch for cheap 
*Christelle Marfaing, Head of Data, May*
#### How to build your stack 
* define and model your target 
  * Ingestion and processing frameworks
  * technical monitoring
  * data quality
  * docs
  * analysis tools
* build and model a road map

#### How to build a team
* decentralize 
* data mesh
* don't decentralize for nothing or reorganize all the time.
* learn to let people go. 

### Graph neural networks 
*Nadya Chernyavskaya, Senior Reasearcher, CERN*

#### What is a graph
* a set of nodes and edges with some features
* directed/undirected, connected/disconnected, sel-loops, 
* they offer much more flexibility

#### What are they for ? 
* node level: predict a property of a node 
* edge, link level : predict links between two nodes 
* subgraph level: detect if nodes form a community (for ex: diagnostics) 
* graph level : molecule property prediction for example 

#### How to implement and represent a graph neural network
* create adjacency matrix, or edge list, or adjacency list 
* a graph can then be implemented into a feature matrix and adjacency matrix 
* each node has to keep its own local information, take new information into account and update it's state based on the previous two. 

#### impact ?
example Google maps:
* nodes: road segments
* edges : connectivity between road segments
* prediction: time of arrival

#### Conclusion
* **When ?** Graph neural networks is a very powerful tool for complex and sparse data
* **What for ?** They can be successfully applied to a variety of different tasks such as node classification, graph classfication, edge prediction, etc...
* **How ?** We learned how to convert graph into ML read representation and build GNN
