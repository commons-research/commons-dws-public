nf-core/metaboigniter is a bioinformatics pipeline that ...

This pipeline ingests raw mass spectrometry data in mzML format, typically in the form of peak lists and MS2 spectral data, for comprehensive metabolomics analysis. The key stages involve centroiding, feature detection, adduct detection, alignment, and linking, which progressively refine and align the data. The pipeline can also perform requantification to compensate for missing values and leverages MS2Query for compound identification based on MS2 data, outputting a comprehensive list of detected and potentially identified metabolites.
