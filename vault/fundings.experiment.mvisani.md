Experiment is a platform for funding scientific discoveries.

It is an all-or-nothing funding platform. This means the project must reach the funding target, or no one's pledges are charged.

# Title
Here are some ideas for the title of the project:
- Predicting the molecules of life with AI
- Predicting the molecules of Earth
- Where are our best medicines ? 
- Predicting the chemistry of life
- Can AI help us predict the chemistry of life ? 
- Predicting the molecules of life

## About This Project
The Earth Metabolome Initiative aims to identify and protect the chemistry of Life. The largely unexplored metabolic diversity, which is rapidly disappearing due to species extinction, is vital for human health, nutrition. In order to uncover and protect this essential natural resource, this initiative launches a worldwide sampling and digitization project that will encourage cooperation. Our goals include protecting biodiversity, advancing life sciences, and assisting human society by developing sustainable solutions through the creation of an open, accessible, and interoperable Earth Metabolome Knowledge Base and faster global metabolome discovery.

## What is the context of this research?
The Earth's metabolic diversity, fundamental to biosphere processes, faces an alarming decline as species disappear. The Earth Metabolome Initiative responds to this crisis with a collaborative, global effort to sample and digitize this diversity, creating resources and technologies for accelerated metabolome discovery.

## What is the significance of this project?
1. Advance Life Sciences: Systematically expand knowledge on global chemodiversity, placing it in the context of biosphere processes and functions. This contributes to the advancement of life sciences and a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships within ecosystems.

2. Benefit Human Society: Develop novel, sustainable solutions in agriculture, medicine, and other fields by connecting metabolites with their roles in living systems. This effort aims to improve human well-being and address societal challenges through the application of metabolome knowledge.

3. Protect Biodiversity: Provide critical information for monitoring, develop novel metrics, and inform predictive tools to prioritize protection and incentivize conservation. The Earth Metabolome Knowledge Base becomes a valuable resource for safeguarding biodiversity and guiding conservation efforts.

## What are the goals of the project?
Currently, we are in the process of developing the EMI portal, a website designed to enable users to upload and access their data, transforming simple mass spectrometry data into a Knowledge Graph. To spearhead this development, we've brought on board Junior Scientist Marco Visani under a 6-month contract. With full funding, we aim to extend Marco's contract for an additional 6 months to ensure the completion of the EMI portal.

Additionally, Marco is actively involved in crafting a machine learning algorithm designed to predict the occurrence of metabolites in different species. This cutting-edge algorithm is slated for integration into the EMI portal, further enhancing its capabilities and utility.
