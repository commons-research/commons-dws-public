# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily open-notebook.

## Doing

- refactoring traits and templates so as to have the possibility to generate daily open-notebooks notes across all public and private Dendrons. 
Let's see if the fact to have a common `open-notebook.`hierarchy cross Dendron workspace doesn't leads to conflicts.

Apparently this implies to copy individual Dendron's Note traits to the Multiworkspace Dendron but shortcuts can be shared.
