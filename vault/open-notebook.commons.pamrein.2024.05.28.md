## Daily report (What did I learn?)
The splitted files runned for ca. 1 day. It generated 620 GB of "compounds and reactions".

After combining the compounds and reactions I have got 160GB of resultlist. 
I also realised, that some parts are missing. After checking the mails, I saw that some of the job run out of memory...

the cachedecorater saves the results between some steps. So you don't have to rerun it...

TODO: - Read the dock for lazyframes

### bash commands
`du -h` - check the foldersize as humanreadable thing.

`lsquota` - check the available size
`du -h . | sort -rh`- ckeck the foldersize and sort them.
