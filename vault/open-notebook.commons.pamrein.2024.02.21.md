# PAMREIN's daily Open Notebook (COMMONS Lab) [2024.02.21]

## Todo - [Check Github](https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/projects/2/views/1)
- Read Paper's (find the subject of the thesis)


## Paper's
### [LOTUS](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70780)
[LOTUS (LOpen Knowledge Management in Natural Products Research)](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net) is a database of over 750'000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. A structure-organims pairs shows the relationship between organisms and molecules.
With the increasing technology, the data for chemical compounds (exp. mass specrometry) and organisms (exp. sequencing machines) also increases exponentialy. To link the data will be more and more beneficial.  
The idea of LOTUS is to interconnect the three central objects of the living (metabolites, proteins and genes).  

Step 1 - Data harmonization:  
The information comes from different sources, which has to be harmonized/standardized for building the new DB. 
The scripts involves a comparison with the gathered data to ensure no duplication (SSOT).  

Step 2 - Precessing and Validation:    
The tree central objects where taken togheter. Mostly the references was particularly challenging (poor quality). 
An unit test checked the code after each changes for the same results.


Step 3 - Dissemination:  
The researchdata should be accessible following the FAIR principles. SPARQL are generic queries to return specific "tables". 
To be find, they have to be in a specific format.


#### Link's
[KNAPSAck]() 50'000+ structures and 100'000+ structure-organism pairs  
[NAPRA-LERT dataset]() well documented database but not available for free  
[NPAtlas]() specificly for microbial NPs.  
[COCONUT]() COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (similar to LOTUS)  
[natural products online](https://naturalproducts.net/) - Host for Lotus, Coconut ...  


#### Question's
- The search of "cocain" give you two answers but kind of the same information. Why? https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/search/simple/cocain

## Daily report (What did I learned?)



## Future perspective
- What is the easiest way to build a knowledge database for this masterthesis?
