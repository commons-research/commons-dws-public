## Context
Looking into nginx to setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server 

This was done on the metabomaps server for the graphDB instance with the help of Jo.
Trying to reproduce here.
## Need
setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server

## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)
Third, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).
- [ ] Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c

They indicate that the conf file is usually under etc/nginx.
Indeed over there on the metabomaps server.

Lets looks at the commonslab server
Not there.

Lets install this

Following https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-nginx#2-installing-nginx


We get the following error when starting nginx 

(base) allardpm@biolpc045600:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ systemctl status nginx.service
‚óè nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

       Docs: man:nginx(8)

    Process: 3544102 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)


Following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51525710/nginx-failed-to-start-a-high-performance-web-server-and-a-reverse-proxy-server

we 
 sudo service apache2 stop

 Amazing !


 
- [ ] So this was a first step.
Apparently certbot was used later one. Lets see how this one works

https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal

I added the ip of the commons lab server to the dbgi DNS
And can now vie the previously made placeholder website when serving on port 80

However the certbot step is not working 
sudo certbot --nginx

And returns

Yeah !! But thats on the metabomaps server. Apparently thing will not work that smoothly on the commons server sinc it is behind the university firewall
running (saved as a .sh script)
 certbot --authenticator standalone --installer nginx   -d xxxxxxx.xxxx.org --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"




- [ ] So I can serve the nocodb instance hosted on the commonslab server via a .dbgi.org domains

nginx server file is as follows

server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;

       server_name xxxxx.dbgi.org;

  # If you would like to gzip your stuff
  gzip on;
  gzip_min_length 1;
  gzip_types *;

  # Setup the proxy
  # This will forward all requests to the server
  # and then it will relay the servers response back to the client
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
