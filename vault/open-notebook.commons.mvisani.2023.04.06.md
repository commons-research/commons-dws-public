# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.04.06


## Notes
I think the model we have can work quite nicely with the Lotus database. I have generated some fake data and am trying to predict the parameters given to the model. It looks like it works pretty well. 

Also we performed Gibbs sampling for trying to predict X given $\mu$ and $\epsilon_c$ it seems like it is able to find X fast and accurately !

## Todo today

## Done
* Finished implementing MCMC for predicting both gamma, delta and X. Works like a charm !
