## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Which prog language is the best?  
Does it depends on the usage or other stuff? 
Marco showed me today rust. It looks very easy to use and they have a lot of implemented tools, which are very useful. 
Like Julia, it can also work with other packages which increases the possibilties of the language.
