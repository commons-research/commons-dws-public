I have been contacted by an editor of Natural Products Reports proposing to write a Viewpoint paper on Open Science in natural products research.
I am interested but have some fear in committing to yet another project given the current list of running tasks.

I have decide to give it a try but following this method.
I'll work on this project by small chunks of 15 min daily. No more, no less. This will also be a methodological experiment.

Got inspired by this article in Science (find ref)

### Plan

Today I'll set up the template for note taking for this project and will answer the email of the editor.
Actually I might not need to create yet another daily template. And will keep notes in this one.

Drafting notes there [[viewpoint]].

Email sent.
