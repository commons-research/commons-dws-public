## Notes

## Todo 
* simulate $\epsilon_c$ from multivariate normal distribution with mean = 0 and cov `prob_sigma`
* from x simulate Lotus from x and P and Q --> R 
* from R draw Bernoulli with P = R
* --> simulated data
* from simulated data try to do the opposite :
  * try to infer $\gamma$ and $\delta$ from MCMC --> should find our $\delta$ and $\gamma$

## Doing


## Done

## Todo tomorrow
