# Hacking Scholia for custom SPARQL endpoints discord

https://github.com/SWAT4HCLS/Biohackathon-SWAT4HCLS-2023/issues/4
This hack project is following up efforts of other to repurpose the Scholia platform for other SPARQL endpoints, like custom Wikibase installations or Wikidata subsets. In this project we will explore how we can make the Scholia code base configurable for the aspects to show, and which panels to show.
If the project is successful, we have a custom Scholia instance around any of the existing public SPARQL endpoints (e.g. ChEMBL, UniProt/NextProt, etc).

Expertise needed
SPARQL coding, and/or
Python coding (Flask experience particularly welcome)

From Egon
> good morning. I am finishing some teaching before we start around 9am CET
> hacking ideas for this project include:
> 1. global configurable SPARQL endpoint URL
> 2. configurable subset of aspects to run
> 3. mappings between Wikibase properties and classes with Wikidata equivalents (so that SPARQL can be in the "Wikidata language" but translated to the "Wikibase language" before being run)
> 4. extract mapping of Wikidata classes (Q-ids) to Scholia aspects into a config file
> 

oh, and yes, this project will write a BioHackrXiv report

### Discussion with Tarcisio, Ana & Marco

- small sized RDF (see PCM molecules) are a thing to investigate
- check into Wikibase installs
- have a RDF with no GraphDB dependenat specification (should easily go to GraphDb and Virtuoso for ex)
- nonopubs website changed its now at https://nanopub.net/
