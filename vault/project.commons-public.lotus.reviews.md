One of the reviewers' comments was that the LOTUS manuscript lacked presentation of practical applications.


In order to adress we could take recent example of classical NP reviews saying "in the last x years z compounds have been isolated from source z" see Table 1.
And see how a LOTUS based query would compare.

Looked for 'natural products of actinobacteria review' in 2021  https://scholar.google.ch/scholar?as_ylo=2021&q=natural+products+of+actinobacteria+review&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5

Found this one : 
https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0944501321000148?token=12BB9774EF1AF4C4D7387565CBC96DC31DE1BF26C75CDDAF82A56D2AB0AE1F8ED050ABC8F3131097C646B9F5A06A1DD1&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20210828164327

Let's try to build Table 1 on our side. 


All compounds from Actinobacteria (and childrens) with DOI https://w.wiki/3yPg
