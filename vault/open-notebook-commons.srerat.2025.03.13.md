## Done
Learned the step following the weighting: extraction
Don't be fooled, it's not the MS's part yet.

A peculiar solution must be prepared in order to proceed. It is composed of 80% methanol (99,8%), 20% distilled water, and 0,1% formic acid. All the components can be found in the orange safe closet, in the machine room.
EloÃ¯se recommended to prepare a total volume of 200ml for easier calculation=> 160ml methanol, 40ml water, 0.2ml formic acid. Thats smart.
It is not always necessary to prepare such solution. If some is left, it is still possible to use it.
For each new solution, a blank must be prepared. It should allow to detect the molecular noise present in the tubes and vials

Next step is the shaker room.
Here, the plants in the tubes will be pulverised by the super-shaker. Be sure to screw the screws all the way.
Beat the shit out of the shaked tubes to make the dust fall off the inner portion of the lid.
After the beating, go in the "chapelle" add 1,5ml of the peculiar solution in the individual tubes. Be wary not the touch the tube with the pump to avoid contaminations.
After being filled with the liquid, the tubes must go back for another shaking.

They must now go for a 2 minutes/13'000 rounds in the centrifuge.

Now, prepare the small glass vials, a square container, take the tablet and the printer and go to a chapelle. 
There, transfer the liquid part of the tubes in the glass vials. Avoid taking any solid parts.
DO NOT FORGET TO PRINT THE LABELS !
The square containers must be left in the super freezer downstairs at the end of the day. It is possible the software will indicate that the container aint full even though it is. Its because the blanks can't be registered for now.

Now the samples should be finally ready for MS (hurray)

## Notes

## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never 
Notify someone that i might have fucked up concerning the volume of solution in the small glass vials (1,5ml instead of 150ml). Before starting pipeting the solution in the vials, it is necessary to indicate the volume, type of vial, container, ...
