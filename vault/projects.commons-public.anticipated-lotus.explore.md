Discussed in group meeting today.

Maybe explore MCS (Maximum Common Substructure) to establish a tress of the LOTUS structural set.

Very likely Luca should have some ideas on this and this is a subgraph search problemeatic. 

Would offer the advantage over and complement classical chemical classifiers as we would have a chemical structures associated with higher taxonomomical levels.
