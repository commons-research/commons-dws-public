## Doing
I forgot to do yesterday's log. So here it is.
The sampling of trees finally started (yay!).
It is regular sampling, but an additionnal picture of the specimen QR-code must be taken and added to the comment section of the second "onglet" (maybe ecological metadata?).
I made a sign code to determine which organs have already been collected and what's left to sample. A will post a picture of it if I remember to.
However, the category bark, and maybe branch are missing. Maybe the branch category is redundant, as a branch is a secondary stem. We will see.
I should ask Edouard to add them if possible.

## Paused

## Done

## Notes

## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never 
[]Ask Edouard to add the categories "bark", and "branch" to the sample type.
