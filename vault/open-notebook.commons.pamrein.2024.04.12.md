## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Numba: Python package for "in time" compyling.

micromamba is an environment control program, which I am using for the cluster in bern. 
<https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html>. 
This is the way, how I am able to run different python versions.
I tried also conda, which didn't worked...

If srun: use --partition=pibu_el8

file xxx : gives you the format of the file xxx
lsquota: gives you the disk usage info of your project/group

Because of ibu cluster problems, I ve got the advice from bertier to reinstall conda, pyenv and ....
I deleted Conda, pyenv and micromamba. Poetry (I guess) was in an environment and also deleted.

The reinstalling process is still going on.
