# This is Simon's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.

Today is 2025.04.11
All the gymnosperms (except one) north of the system have been sampled.
I believe I have more than 50 specimens collected by now. I will then reduce the sampling to only 1 day a week (friday) and use the others to prepare the samples for the lc-ms.
Next step in the collection process:
  - Check if there are any new flowering trees
  - Start the arboretum

DONT FORGET: NEEDLES NEED DISC BEADS.
