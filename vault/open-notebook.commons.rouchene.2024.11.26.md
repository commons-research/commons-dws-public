## Doing
Goog paper: describe a compound-first approach to natural product discovery in which adsorbent resins capture compounds directly from the environments in which they are produced. Using this technique, which we call SMIRC, natural products were captured and purified from a marine deployment site in sufficient quantities to elucidate the structures of cabrillostatin (1) and the halogenated polyketides cabrillospirals A and B (2-3), which represent two new carbon skeletons
