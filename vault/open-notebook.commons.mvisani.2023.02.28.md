# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.02.28


## Notes
### Watched Madleina's presentation on presentation about sex determination
let us denote $n_{ic}$ the number of reads in individual i in contig c. We have :

$$
n_{ic} \propto Multinomial(N_i, \pi_{ic}) \\

\tilde{\pi_{ic}} = \gamma_c (p_{ic} + \epsilon) \\

\tilde{\pi_{ic}} = \frac{\tilde{\pi_{ic}}}{\sum_{c=1}^c \tilde{\pi_{ic}}}
$$
