# Ted Nelson

Ted Nelson is a pioneer in the field of computer science and information technology, best known for coining the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia." He envisioned a global information system that would allow users to easily navigate and link documents in a non-linear fashion, which laid the groundwork for the development of the World Wide Web.
