So gehört der Weissdorn hierher, obwohl er hierzulande fast stet als niedriger, vielstämmiger Strauch zu sehen ist. Es gibt von ihm nämlich einige Arten, die über 10m hoch werden. Die Hasel stellt einen Grenzfall dar, während Holunder und Hartiriegl einwandfrei.\nDiese Definition trifft für einige Kultivare (Sorten) von Koniferen nicht zu. Wenn diese trotzdem aufgenommen wurden, so deshalb, weil sie Formen \"echter\" Bäume darstellen und aus diesem Grunde dazu gehören.\"\nIn english:\n\"A tree is a woody, perennial plant that reaches a height of at least about 6 metres; the trunk can branch very far down, but this must be above the ground. So much for the definition. In this work, genera were then listed in full, i.e. with all important species. Hawthorn, for example, belongs here, although in this country it is almost always seen as a low, multi-stemmed shrub. There are some species of hawthorn that grow to over 10 metres in height. The hazel is a borderline case, while the elderberry and the dogwood are perfect.\nThis definition does not apply to some cultivars (varieties) of conifers. If these are included anyway, it is because they are forms of ‘real’ trees and therefore belong here.\"\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)\n\nAs there are no universal description of what a tree is, I will propose a first definition for this bachelor work.\nA plant referred to as a tree is perennial, is lignified, has a trunk.

But excludes banana trees, papaya trees, shrubs\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.041:\nIt is quite philosophical as there is a general idea of what a tree is, but no clear botanical description. We could say that \"tree\" refers to the classical oak style plant.

Unlike,the majority of plants already sampled, trees are perennial and tend to present harder parts (bark, trunk, ...). This presents a first challenge for the already tested DBGI method. As of now, the method defines each sample as being its own unit. In the case of trees, this simplification is somewhat limiting as the different organs (which might be quite numerous) can't all be linked to a single individual through the already established informatical system.\nThe hardness of the tissues could also cause a problem by not breaking properly with the metal beads. However, this issue might be overcome by the use of disc shaped beads that should slice right through.\n\nAll the (remaining) trees in the botanical garden need to be sampled for this bachelor's work. They are scattered all over the garden, with a greater concentration in the arboretum, and near the fences as hedges. They tend to come from all over the world with local species (Picea abies) aswell as tropical ones (Persea americana). \nHow are they placed in the garden ? Taxonomic/usefulness reasons? Remains of the old organisation of the garden ?\n\n- Sampling\n\n  The classical DBGI methodology was mostly applied to collect the different organs. The main difference being the use of ladders, and telescopic cutting tools.\n  For each sample, the geographical position of the specimen will be marked down on a QField map. Additional data, such as photos:\n  1) the identification panel\n  2) the identification panel with the number of the sample\n  3)  photo of the whole specimen\n  4) a detailled photo of the leaves/flowers/seeds/fruits, \n  5) the sampled zone \n  6) Additional photo, if judged necessary\n  will be taken.\n\n  The photos, and the location will then be imported on iNaturalist for receving further confirmation of the species. This, in term, should allow the identification of sampled species in the wild without having to take an expert in the field\n  A branch will be cutted down. From the fallen branch, leaves/needles, bark, twigs, flowers, fruits will be collected. => this will need to be rewritten after the first samplings.\n  After the cut, the organ is wrapped in a brown coffee filter, and shoved in a falcon tube closed with a perforated cap. Each tube is pre-labeled with a unique QR-code that will allow to identify and track the sample through the extraction process and the storage.\n  The tube are then dunked in liquid nitrogen. They will finally be put to rest in the freezer (-80C), if they can't be freeze-dryed immediately. The freeze-drying process needs to be at least 72 hours long to make sure the samples is absolutely dry. \n  Directly after the freeze-drying process, all the perforated caps need to be switched out with standard, desinfected, non-perforated caps. The falcon tubes are then stored in a labeled rack. They need to be scanned to allow the system to track them.\n \n\n- Extraction \n\n  The first step of the extraction process is weighing out 50 milligrams (!!0.0500 g sur la machine!!) of each sample. An error of 5% (+-2,5mg) was accepted. The matter is weigthed in a 2 ml Eppendorf with a rounded bottom. Depending on the weight, metal beads are added. Less than 20mg =1; between 20mg-50mg = 2beads, around 50mg= 3 beads(this may change with the new discoid beads).\n  => shape of beads depends on type of sample.\n\n  The samples go in the MM400 Retsch machine for 2.5 minutes at 25Hz. Then, 1,5ml(why not the same as Héloïse and Edouard's protocol ?) of the classic DBGI extraction solution. It is a mix of 80% methanol, 20% distilled water, and 0,1% formic acid. The newly rehydrated samples go back in the Retsch machine with the same settings.\n  The tubes are then taking a turn in a centrifugation machine for 2 minutes at 13'000 RPM to separate the supernatant from the plant deposit.\n  Finally, as much of the supernatant (usually 1,4 ml) is collected and pipetted in a glass vial with a hermetically sealed cap (the red ones).\n  The vial need to be labelled and associated to a container ensuring the tracking of the sample from the garden to the MS.\n  This final step needs to be performed under a bench.\n  The vials container is then stored in the freezer (-80C), and is ready for MS and further analysis.\n\n- Analysis ?\n\n\n\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n[] Start the collect of differents tree organs (bark if possible, leaves, seeds, flowers/reproductive organs, buds, twigs/small branches)\n[]Continue with sample preparation\n[] Download Zotero ?\n[] Check the list of plants, and trees of the garden\n[] Find a way to automatically copy/paste what is in the to do list of the previous entry into the newest log\n[] When grinding woody parts for the first time, check if they need to rest a longer time in the extraction solution (cells not well enough broken).

Approximately 140 trees and their different organs (leaves, bark, seeds, flowers, fruits, twigs, and buds) will have to be sampled.\nThis will multiply the number of total samples by a factor of 3-4 depending on how I feel it, and the availability of the organ.\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n[x]Ask the seretaries for an access key to the building and the garden\n[x] Take a stroll in the garden to see where a QR code could be attached to a specimen (use big plastified sheets, a string, roll that string around the nails in the trees)\n[x] => Ask Alain if it is okay.

Not sure. Is it simply maceration or sublimation ? \n- Maybe the method of extraction is sublimation/maceration, and the LC is the method of separation. If this is the case, another article should be found, for this one doesn't include sublimation.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/232089322_Isolation_identification_and_purification_of_cinnamaldehyde_from_Cinnamomum_zeylanicum_bark_oil_An_antibacterial_study\n- Extraction of a very specific bark component in the tree Cinnamomum zelyanicum\n- Use of steam distillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 8h to extract the essential oils. Maybe this is a method proper to essential oils extraction, but unfit for all bark components ? Would it be mass-spec friendly ?\n\nRichard, B., Bénard, A., Dumarçay, S. et al. Wood, knots and bark extractives for oak, beech and Douglas fir: a dataset based on a review of the scientific literature. Annals of Forest Science 81, 9 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13595-024-01223-0\n- Have a very similar project of mapping the metabolome of a few species (Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea Liebl., Fagus sylvatica L. and Pseudotsuga menziesii ) in France, and in the whole organism.\n- Wood_db-chemistry database, EXTRAFOR_EST scientific project\n- Database is available\n- Used 12 different extraction techniques, are note described in the paper cuz it is a metaanalysis\n- Many links to papers and their method of extraction (https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57745/QZYPUA) => need to take a look later \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/230771042_Handbook_Of_Wood_Chemistry_And_Wood_Composites. https://doi.org/10.1201/b12487\n- Introduction book on wood/bark chemistry, and their extractives\n- chemical constituents of bark can be classified into four major groups: polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectic materials); lignin and polyphenols; hydroxy acid complexes (suberin); and extractives (fats, oils, phytosterols, resin acids, waxes, tannins, terpenes, phlobaphenes, and flavonoids). \n- The analysis methods developed for wood cannot be used for bark directly. - There are many compounds in bark that are not found in wood that interfere with these analysis methods. Because of the interference of the extractives in polysaccharide and lignin analysis, procedures for elucidation of the chemical composition of bark begin with an extraction protocol that consists \nof sequential extraction solvents of increasing polarity. A common protocol begins with a diethyl ether extraction step that yields waxes, fatty acids, fats, resin acids, phytosterols, and terpenes. This is followed by an ethyl alcohol extraction step that yields condensed tannins, flavonoids, and phenolics. The third step uses hot water, and yields condensed tannins and water-soluble carbohydrates. To release phenolic acids, hemicelluloses, and suberin monomers from the residue from the third step, 1% aqueous sodium hydroxide is used (Holloway and Deas 1973, Kolattukudy 1984). The extract fractions from the above-mentioned steps are then subjected to further workup to separate each into easy-to-analyze mixtures of compounds. For example, partitioning the diethyl ether fraction against aqueous sodium bicarbonate separates the fatty acids and resin acids from the neutral components, tannins, terpenes, and flavonoids. The neutral fraction is then \nsaponified to give the alcohols and salts of fatty acids, dicarboxylic, hydroxy-fatty, and ferulic acids. Ethanol extraction followed by hot water extraction of the insoluble ether fraction yields soluble simple sugars and condensed tannins. Sodium hydroxide extraction of the insoluble residue gives soluble suberin monomers, phenolic acids, and hemicelluloses. Sulfuric acid treatment of the insoluble fraction yields lignin (Chang and Mitchell 1955, Hemingway 1981, Laks 1991).\n- Why no use of MS ? Is it a very recent tech ?\n- Procedure for extraction varies between labs. No comparison between data is thus possible.\n\nTanase C, Coșarcă S, Muntean D-L.

It is composed of 80% methanol (99,8%), 20% distilled water, and 0,1% formic acid. All the components can be found in the orange safe closet, in the machine room.\nEloïse recommended to prepare a total volume of 200ml for easier calculation=> 160ml methanol, 40ml water, 0.2ml formic acid. Thats smart.\nIt is not always necessary to prepare such solution. If some is left, it is still possible to use it.\nFor each new solution, a blank must be prepared. It should allow to detect the molecular noise present in the tubes and vials\n\nNext step is the shaker room.\nHere, the plants in the tubes will be pulverised by the super-shaker. Be sure to screw the screws all the way.\nBeat the shit out of the shaked tubes to make the dust fall off the inner portion of the lid.\nAfter the beating, go in the \"chapelle\" add 1,5ml of the peculiar solution in the individual tubes. Be wary not the touch the tube with the pump to avoid contaminations.\nAfter being filled with the liquid, the tubes must go back for another shaking.\n\nThey must now go for a 2 minutes/13'000 rounds in the centrifuge.\n\nNow, prepare the small glass vials, a square container, take the tablet and the printer and go to a chapelle. \nThere, transfer the liquid part of the tubes in the glass vials. Avoid taking any solid parts.\nDO NOT FORGET TO PRINT THE LABELS !\nThe square containers must be left in the super freezer downstairs at the end of the day. It is possible the software will indicate that the container aint full even though it is. Its because the blanks can't be registered for now.\n\nNow the samples should be finally ready for MS (hurray)\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \nNotify someone that i might have fucked up concerning the volume of solution in the small glass vials (1,5ml instead of 150ml).

Take the tubes out of the nitrogen, and put them in a plastic bag (20 per bag).\n\nAs of now, we should ask Stefanie Ranf for permission to use the lyophylisation machine.

A bead beating step was added to assist with mechanical lysis of the fungal cell wall. A viability study showed that these steps resulted in no growth of a variety of diverse clinically relevant fungi, including both yeasts and molds (Supplemental Table S2). For all samples, the Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA) EZ1 Blood and Tissue Kit as well as the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument were used (following manufacturer’s instructions) to extract genomic DNA from fungal isolates. Post extraction, DNA was quantified using Qubit 1× double-stranded DNA HS assay with the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA quantities greater than 0.04 ng/µL were considered acceptable. PCR grade water was used as a negative extraction and sequencing control. A reference strain of Candida tropicalis (CDC AR Bank 3045) was used as a sequencing positive control for each run [ doi: 10.3390/jof9020183]. \nJe résume:\n1. Inactivation des isolats : Tous les isolats fongiques ont été traités avec de l'éthanol à 70 % et chauffés à 100°C pendant 30 minutes pour être inactivés. Ce traitement par la chaleur et l'alcool élimine la viabilité des champignons, empêchant leur croissance, ce qui est confirmé par une étude montrant l'absence de croissance après ces étapes, même pour des champignons cliniquement importants (levures et moisissures).\n\n2. Lyse mécanique : Une étape de broyage avec des billes (\"bead beating\") est ajoutée pour aider à briser la paroi cellulaire des champignons, qui est très résistante. Cette étape facilite la libération de l'ADN contenu à l'intérieur des cellules fongiques.\n\n3. Extraction de l'ADN : Le kit Qiagen EZ1 Blood and Tissue et l’instrument EZ1 Advanced XL ont été utilisés pour extraire l'ADN génomique des isolats, en suivant les instructions du fabricant.\n\n4. Quantification de l'ADN : Après l'extraction, la quantité d'ADN est mesurée avec le test Qubit 1× double-brin d’ADN HS et le fluoromètre Qubit 3.0. Seules les quantités supérieures à 0,04 ng/µL sont considérées comme acceptables pour les analyses suivantes.\n\n5.Contrôles de qualité : De l'eau de qualité PCR est utilisée comme contrôle négatif pour s'assurer qu'aucune contamination n'est introduite pendant l'extraction et le séquençage. Une souche de référence de Candida tropicalis (CDC AR Bank 3045) sert de contrôle positif pour vérifier la qualité et la précision de chaque séquençage.\n\n\n## Culture V1 in TSB for tomorrow \n\n## Sequencing platforme \nLes plateformes de séquençage Illumina HiSeq, PacBio Sequel II, et Nanopore PromethION sont des technologies avancées utilisées pour le séquençage de l'ADN, mais elles se différencient en termes de méthode de séquençage, de précision, de longueur de lecture, et de coût. Voici un aperçu de chaque plateforme :\n1. Illumina HiSeq Platform\nTechnologie de Séquençage : Illumina utilise une méthode de \"séquençage par synthèse\". Les brins d'ADN sont fragmentés et chaque fragment est amplifié pour former des clusters. Lors du séquençage, des bases fluorescentes sont ajoutées une à une, et chaque fluorescence est capturée par une caméra.\nLongueur de Lecture : Cette plateforme produit généralement des lectures de courte longueur (entre 50 et 300 paires de bases par lecture).\nAvantages : Haute précision et faible taux d'erreur, adaptée aux projets nécessitant une couverture profonde, comme l'exome ou le génome complet.\nInconvénients : Longueur de lecture limitée, donc moins adaptée à l'assemblage de génomes complexes et à la détection de certaines variations structurelles.\n2. PacBio Sequel II Platform\nTechnologie de Séquençage : Utilise la technologie de séquençage par observation directe d'une enzyme polymérase, appelée SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time sequencing). L'ADN n'est pas amplifié ; la plateforme lit directement les longues molécules d'ADN.\nLongueur de Lecture : Produits de très longues lectures (jusqu'à 100 000 bases), avec une longueur moyenne d’environ 10 000-30 000 bases.\nAvantages : Adaptée aux séquences complexes et aux longues répétitions, idéale pour l’assemblage de novo de génomes et pour détecter des variations structurelles.\nInconvénients : Coût élevé par rapport aux plateformes Illumina, avec un taux d’erreur plus élevé, même s'il est réduit avec les lectures corrigées par consensus.\n3. Nanopore PromethION Platform\nTechnologie de Séquençage : La technologie de Nanopore permet de séquencer en temps réel en faisant passer une molécule d'ADN à travers un nanopore et en mesurant les changements de courant électrique pour identifier les bases.\nLongueur de Lecture : Elle peut produire des lectures extrêmement longues, dépassant plusieurs centaines de milliers de bases.\nAvantages : Longueur de lecture quasiment illimitée et rapidité de séquençage en temps réel. Elle est portable et peut être utilisée pour des séquençages directement sur le terrain.\nInconvénients : Taux d'erreur plus élevé que les autres plateformes, bien que les taux d’erreur aient diminué avec les améliorations technologiques.\nEn résumé, le choix de la plateforme dépendra du type de projet de séquençage : Illumina pour les projets nécessitant une haute précision et une profondeur de couverture, PacBio pour des lectures longues et une bonne résolution des régions répétées, et Nanopore pour les lectures ultra-longues et les séquençages rapides en temps réel.\n## \n\n## Lab work today \nDNA extraction of CH2 and CH6, both liquid and solide culture \nculture V1 from the stock to avoid contamination \n## To do this week \nStorage all active strains in glycerol 70% at -80°C.\n## claen your samples \n## Today 30-11-2024\nDNA extraction and purification of CH2, CH4 and V1 \nResults\nPCR Does'n work for CH4 and V1 i have to redo extraction!\n## Tomorrow 31-10-24\nstorage of all strains \nredo DNA isolation of CH4 solide and liquid media \n### Summary of the Week (10-26-2024)\n\nI cultivated the remaining strains CH2, CH4, and V1, and performed a DNA extraction. \nI successfully obtained the sequence for CH2 only.

Methods for in vitro evaluating antimicrobial activity: A review (classicmethodes) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2015.11.005.\n3. Production of inactivated gram-positive and gram-negative species with preserved cellular morphology and integrity: une étude comparative des différentes méthodes utilisées pour inactiver des bactéries, c'est-à-dire les rendre métaboliquement mortes tout en conservant leur intégrité cellulaire. Cela signifie que les bactéries doivent être inactivées de manière à ce que leur structure cellulaire, notamment la paroi et la membrane, soit préservée, tout en minimisant la fuite de protéines et d'ADN intracellulaires. Ce type de bactéries inactivées est essentiel pour des applications spécifiques, telles que l'étude des signaux déclenchés par des récepteurs ou l’analyse des interactions bactérie-cellule qui nécessitent de longues périodes d'incubation. Bacterial inactivation with ethanol, formalin, NaOH, UV-C and BPL results in 100% inactivation efficacy. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2021.106208).  \n## Protocol inscaativation: \n1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions\nEight strains of bacteria from five phyla were selected as representatives for the structural differences in bacterial cell walls of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains to evaluate the inactivation efficacy of each method (Table 1). The anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis 9343 NTBF, Parabacteroides distasonis 3999B T(B)4, Fusobacterium nucleatum patient isolate NTB17 (from the Radboudumc strain collection), Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 were cultured in an anaerobic jar using sachets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI) broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with L-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), yeast extract (BD, USA), hemin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), vitamin K1 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 48 h at 37 °C. Facultative aerobic strains such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium NTB6 (Kortman et al., 2014) (further designated as S. typhimurium), Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus UCN34 (further designated as S. gallolyticus), Escherichia coli NC101 and Lactococcus lactis IL1403 were cultured aerobically in BHI broth overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n2. Following incubation, optical density at 620 nm was measured in the microplate reader Infinite F50 (Tecan, Switzerland) and samples were centrifuged at maximum speed (16,100 x g) for 10 min. Supernatants were discarded and OD620 was adjusted to 1.0 in 0.9% sodium chloride buffer (B Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) for treatments with BPL (Acros Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and pasteurization. For NaOH, ethanol (all from Merck, Germany) and formalin (formaldehyde solution about 37%, Merck, Germany) treatments, pellets were resuspended at OD620 of 1.0 in NaOH, ethanol and formalin, respectively.\n2.2.2. NaOH, ethanol and formalin treatments\nBacterial pellets (Table 1) were resuspended in 6 mg/ml (0.15 M) NaOH solution (Rabi et al., 2018; Vinod et al., 2014), 70% ethanol (Morton, 1950), or formalin (McDonnell and Russell, 1999), and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2021.106208).\n\n## How to proced?\n1. Culture des bactéries :\n•\tBactéries anaérobies : Cultiver des souches comme Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides distasonis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, et Akkermansia muciniphila dans une boîte à anaérobiose à 37 °C pendant 48 heures en utilisant du milieu Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI) enrichi de L-cystéine, extrait de levure, hémine et vitamine K1.\n•\tBactéries aérobies facultatives : Cultiver des souches comme Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Escherichia coli et Lactococcus lactis en milieu BHI à 37 °C avec 5 % de CO2 pendant 16-18 heures. \n2. Mesure de la densité optique :\n•\tAprès incubation, mesurer la densité optique (DO) des cultures à 620 nm (OD620) à l'aide d'un lecteur de microplaque (par exemple, Tecan Infinite F50).\n•\tCentrifuger les échantillons à 16 100 x g pendant 10 minutes pour récupérer les pellets de bactéries.\n•\tJeter les surnageants et ajuster les pellets de bactéries à OD620 = 1.0 dans une solution saline à 0.9% de NaCl (solution tampon saline, B Braun Melsungen AG).\n3. Traitement avec NaOH, éthanol ou formol :\n•\tPréparer les solutions :\no\tNaOH : 6 mg/ml (0.15 M).\no\tÉthanol : 70 %.\no\tFormol : solution de formaldéhyde à 37 %.\n•\tInactivation :\no\tRésuspendre les pellets de bactéries dans l'une de ces solutions (NaOH, éthanol ou formol) à OD620 = 1.0.\no\tIncuber les bactéries à température ambiante pendant 5 minutes dans ces solutions.\no\tCette incubation permet l'inactivation des bactéries tout en perturbant leurs fonctions métaboliques sans détruire totalement leur structure cellulaire.\n4. Étape finale :\n•\tAprès l'incubation, vous pouvez procéder à des étapes supplémentaires comme la culture des bactéries traitées pour vérifier leur inactivation, ou effectuer des tests pour évaluer l'intégrité de leur paroi cellulaire (par exemple, mesure de la libération d'ADN ou coloration avec des marqueurs fluorescents).\nPour préparer 200 mL de solution de NaCl à 0,9%, vous devez dissoudre 1,8 g de NaCl dans de l'eau distillée et compléter jusqu'à un volume total de 200 mL.\nPour préparer 200 mL NaOH: Vous devez dissoudre 1,2 g de NaOH dans de l'eau distillée et compléter à 200 mL pour obtenir une solution à 6 mg/mL (0,15 M) de NaOH.  \n\n\nNotes:  L’inactivation bactérienne avec de l’éthanol, du formol, du NaOH, des UV-C et du BPL donne une efficacité d’inactivation de 100 %.\n•\tLa pasteurisation a entraîné une inactivation incomplète étant donné que de multiples souches bactériennes proviennent d'espèces différentes.\n•\tL’éthanol et le BPL entraînent une fuite minimale d’ADN, ce qui suggère un effet minimal sur l’intégrité cellulaire.\n•\tLe BPL et le formol ont largement maintenu l'intégrité cellulaire d' E. coli , S. gallolyticus , L. lactis et A. muciniphila .\n\n\n\n### Have a look at the COMMONS research discussion forum\n    -

Jar lids were perforated to make a 1 cm diameter hole into which a rubber septum was inserted. The experiment consisted of two treatments; ASD amended with rice bran (RB) and a no-carbon input ASD control (ASD-NA), seven time points; day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, and 15, with four samples per treatment at each incubation duration point. In total, across all treatments and time points, 56 samples analyzed. For the purposes of this study, RB soil amendment treatment was not included as pathogen suppression (e.g., F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae) was not realized under such conditions (Figure 1). In addition, RB soil incorporation does not yield an anaerobic environment (Mazzola et al., 2018), nor result in amplification of target microbial populations commonly associated with ASD-induced disease suppression, such as Clostridium spp. For the ASD treatment, 1.57 g of RB (equivalent to 20 Mg per ha per 15 cm depth in the field) was homogeneously mixed into soil. Estimated nutrient concentration of RB was C = 47.8%, N = 2.49%, P = 1.53%, K = 1.60%, S = 0.18%, C:N ratio = 19:1, pH = 6.2 (Soiltest Farm Consultants, Inc., Moses Lake, WA, United States). For both treatments, 25 mL of distilled water was added to saturate the soil pore spaces. The headspace volume over the microcosms was 409 mL. Jars were incubated in an environmental growth chamber for 15 days at 24/18°C with 12-h photoperiod. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400–700 nm) just above the jars was 226 μmol m–2 sec–2. Immediately after initiating the experiment, headspace volatiles were extracted, and a representative soil sample was collected using a #3 cork borer (7 cores from each microcosm). Soil samples were placed in a chilled sample cup, followed by immediate immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. This procedure was followed for soil sampling at all incubation duration points. Frozen soil cores were cryogenically milled to a fine powder and stored again at −80°C before use for metabolite analysis. For day 0 and day 1 time points, headspace O2 and CO2 composition was analyzed every 4 h and once for the remaining incubation duration points as described below (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02365/full).\n\n## LC/MS analysis ( soil metabolomics)\nExtraction of the metabolome and LC-MS analysis:\nMethod 1. Extracellular metabolites were extracted from 2 g of wet soil from each sample (with five technical replicates) using 10 ml of deionized water. The samples were shaken on a mechanical shaker for 12 hours at 4°C, then centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C, and finally filtered through 0.2 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters (Pall Corporation, New York, NY, USA). Polar metabolites were completely dried using a rapid vacuum concentrator, then chemically derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/8/1653].\n\nMethod 2. Biocrust soil water samples (1.5 mL) were lyophilized and resuspended in methanol (200 μL) containing internal standards (2–10 μg/mL) and filtered through 96-well Millipore filter plates (0.2 μm PVDF) by centrifuging at 1500 × g for 2 min. Samples were analyzed using normal-phase LC/MS with a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3.5 μm 200 Å, Merck Sequant, Darmstadt, Germany) using an Agilent 1290 series UHPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA)(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02356-9).\n\nMethod 3. (Soil non-targeted metabolomic detection and analysis) Twelve rhizosphere soil samples were sent to Majorbio (Shanghai, China) on dry ice for metabolite extraction, detection, and analysis. In detail, 1,000-mg soil aliquot of each sample was homogenized with 1,000 µL methanol/water (4:1, v/v) solution, including 0.02 mg/mL internal standard (L-2-chlorophenylamine acid) for 6 min at −10 °C and 50 kHz using a Geno-grinder 2,000 (SPEX, Metuchen, NJ, USA) and spun down for 30 min at 5 °C and 40 kHz. After resting for 30 min at −20 °C, each material was centrifuged at 13,000 g (relative centrifugal force) for 15 min at 4 °C, then the supernatant was transferred and concentrated by a Termovap Sample Concentrator (DC-24, Anpel Laboratory Technologies, Shanghai, China). The dry residue was derivatized by adding 50 µL acetonitrile/water (1:1), homogenized for 30 s at 5 °C and 40 kHz, and centrifuged at 13,000 g (relative centrifugal force) for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the supernatant was subjected to LC-tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis; 20 µL supernatant of each sample was mixed for the quality control sample.\nThe UHPLC-Triple TOF system (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 µm; Waters, Milford, CT, USA) was applied to chromatographic separating the metabolites with two mobile phases, phase A (95% water and 5% acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid)) and phase B (5% water (with 0.1% formic acid), 47.5% acetonitrile, and 47.5% isopropanol). The whole system was integrated to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Triple TOFTM 5600th; AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and operated in positive and negative modes [doi: 10.7717/peerj.13254](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8995024/).\n\nMethod 4. The 45 collected soil samples, and 5 blank samples containing no soil, were lyophilized on an Edwards Super Modulyo freeze-drier (SciQuip Ltd., Shropshire, UK) for 7 d. Subsequently, these were ground in a Retsch MM200 stainless steel ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) at a frequency of 20 Hz to aid recovery of metabolites from the microbial biomass (Fiehn et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2015). The samples were then stored in individual sterile glass vials at −80 °C to minimize changes in metabolites (Wellerdiek et al., 2009). The soils were extracted using 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile-isopropanol-water, vortexed for 15 s, shaken at 4 °C for 5 min, centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 2 min, and dried using a CentriVap Benchtop Centrifugal Concentrator (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO) (Barupal et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2019). Non-targeted primary metabolism analysis was performed using a Gerstel Automated Linear Exchange-Cold Injection System (ALEX-CIS) with Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) and Leco Pegasus IV Time Of Flight (TOF) MS at the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Facility using the method of Fiehn (2016). Briefly, 0.5 μl of each sample was injected onto a Rtx-5Sil MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 m i.d with 10 m integrated guard column; 0.25 μm 95% dimethylsiloxane/5% diphenylpolysiloxane coating; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA). Using a He mobile phase, the GC thermal programme was 50 °C for 1 min, ramped to 330 °C at 20 °C min−1 and finally held at 330 °C for 5 min. Upon elution, samples were injected into a Pegasus IV GC-time of flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI), using mass resolution of 17 spectra s−1, from 80 to 500 Da, at −70 eV ionization energy and 1800 V detector voltage with a 230 °C transfer line and 250 °C ion source (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071720300559).\nMethod 5 (3 methods in the same paper): Soil Sample Extractions for NMR and MS Analyses\nExtraction in DMSO\nAntarctic soil (2 g) was suspended in 10 mL of DMSO, sonicated at 37 kHz, pulse, 100 pw, 30 min, 30–60 °C (Elmasonic P 30 H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). Each sample was centrifuged (Beckman Avanti J-20 Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at 20,000× g for 15 min, 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and freeze-dried (Christ Alpha 1-2 LD plus, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The extraction yield was calculated for each sample. Lyophilized samples were stored at −20 °C.\nExtraction in H2O/CH3OH 1:1\nAntarctic soil (2 g) was suspended in 10 mL of MilliQ water/CH3OH 1:1 with 50 µL NaN3 0.3 M to obtain NaN3 1.5 mM (0.01%), sonicated and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was collected and CH3OH evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 °C (Heidolph Rotary Evaporator, Laborota 4000, Heidolph Instruments GmbH & Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany). The water phase was transferred in flask and freeze-dried as above. The extraction yield was calculated for each sample. Lyophilized samples were stored at −20 °C.\nExtraction in H2O/CH3CN 7:3\nAntarctic soil (2 g) was suspended in 10 mL of MilliQ water/CH3CN 7:3 with 50 µL NaN3 0.3 M to obtain NaN3 1.5 mM (0.01%) sonicated at 37 kHz, pulse, 100 pw, 60 min, 30–60 °C, and centrifuged as described above. The extraction was repeated with 10 mL of fresh extraction solution. The supernatants were transferred in a flask and freeze-dried as above. The extraction yield was calculated for each sample. Lyophilized samples were stored at −20 °C (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/15/12340).\nMethod 5 (+ ammonium bicarbonate) 5 g of lyophilized soil were placed in a 25 ml centrifuge tube equipped with a Teflon-lined screw cap and 4 ml of 0.25 M aqueous ammonium bicarbonate, 10 ml methanol, and 5 ml chloroform containing the internal standards for NLFA and PLFA analysis (trinonadecanoin glyceride, Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN, USA; 19:0 phosphatidylcholine, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), were added. The contents of the centrifuge tubes were then sonicated 10 min in a water bath sonicator at room temperature, incubated at room temperature with end-over-end mixing for 2 h, and centrifuged 10 min at 1710 G. The liquid phase was transferred to a 30 ml test tube with a Teflon-lined screw cap, 5 ml each of water and chloroform were added, and the sample mixed by vigorous shaking. After centrifuging for 10 min at 1710 G, 2 layers were formed. The top layer (aqueous phase) contained the water-soluble metabolites while the bottom layer (organic phase) contained the lipids. Each phase was transferred into a separate test tube and evaporated in vacuo using a centrifugal evaporator. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness for NLFA and PLFA analyses while the aqueous phase was evaporated to approximately one-quarter of the original volume for metabolomic analysis. Samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139318309958?casa_token=Ke9s59BsPbMAAAAA:m0W7-gJGUad-_iMOcfnUumQW_JYGiiW9exCDR7bVKgGh0JTUPbzVJq_X2I94sHOyuGtfys5Ftw).\nMethod 7. methanol–chloroform–water method [DOI: 10.1002/etc.2418].\n\n## Determination of Soil Microbial Biodiversity\nThrough amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq):\nThe diversity of soil bacteria and fungi was analyzed through amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). A total of 10 g of frozen soil samples were cooled using liquid nitrogen and ground using a mortar and pestle. Soil DNA (n = 435) was extracted using a DNA Isolation Kit (Powersoil, MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A portion of the bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes were sequenced using the 515F/806R and Euk1391f/EukBr primer sets, respectively (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-021-00906-0.\n\n## Relevance of biolog plates\nECOPLATE : The EcoPlate contains 31 carbon sources that are useful for community analysis. These 31 carbon sources are repeated 3 times to give the scientist more replicates of the data. Communities of microorganisms will give a characteristic reaction pattern called a metabolic fingerprint. From a single EcoPlate, these fingerprint reaction patterns rapidly and easily characterize the community (https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.06.007).\nL’Eco-plate est une microplaque de 96 puits dans lesquels se trouvent un substrat carboné et un colorant. Cette plaque doit être inoculée par une solution environnementale contenant une communauté microbienne provenant notamment du sol. Elle regroupe 3 réplicas d’une série de 31 substrats carbonés et un contrôle négatif (eau). Ces substrats représentent 6 classes différentes de composés carbonés : amines/amides, hydrates de carbone, polymères de carbone, acides carboxyliques, acides aminés, phosphates organiques (Preston-Mafham et al., 2002) (Annexe 1). Ils représentent les sources de carbone les plus retrouvés dans l’environnement terrestre, la majorité d’entre eux étant issus de matière végétale (exemple : D-Xylose). Ce choix de substrats a été déterminé ainsi pour apporter des informations suffisantes et pertinentes dans le cas d’étude des populations bactériennes de l’environnement. Par ailleurs, chaque puits contient aussi un sel de tétrazolium qui sert d’indicateur coloré positif. En effet ce sel va jouer le rôle d’accepteurs d’électron artificiel dans la chaine respiratoire des bactéries. Ainsi, lorsque les bactéries métabolisent le substrat, ce sel est réduit de manière irréversible en un composé violet insoluble : le formazan (Tachon et al., 2009). La production de formazan est alors quantifiée par mesure de la densité optique à 590 nm (OD590nm). L’OD590nm est alors proportionnelle à la consommation du substrat (chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.secure.mg/sites/default/files/2019-01/Ecoplate-Version-Courte.pdf).\nThe limitations: Le principal reproche fait à l’Eco-Plate est que ses conditions d’incubations ne sont pas celles du sol. Il se peut que ce métabolisme ne puisse pas s’exprimer dans le contexte naturel. De plus, l’apport d’une seule source de carbone à la fois induit en effet une pression de sélection vis-à-vis du substrat en faveur de celles ayant un métabolisme rapide supportant une forte concentration en un seul nutriment (Garland et al., 1997 ; Preston-Mafham et al., 2002 ; Muñiz et al., 2014). Le CLPP pourrait donc ne refléter que la capacité d’une communauté bactérienne à supporter les conditions de la plaque : des bactéries capables d’intégrer ce sel de tétrazolium dans leur chaine respiratoire, qu’elles soient cultivables ou non, mais ayant un métabolisme rapide et aérobie, (Winding et al., 1997 ; Preston-Mafham et al., 2002). D’un puits à l’autre, la diversité n’est donc pas la même et elle diminue par rapport à la communauté inoculée (Garland et al., 1997). De plus, alors qu’ils représentent des organismes très actifs dans les sols, les champignons ne sont pas représentés dans les Eco-Plates car ce sel de tétrazolium n’est pas adapté à leur métabolisme. Il existe cependant la plaque Biolog FF adaptée pour les étudier (Preston-Mafham et al., 2002 (chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.secure.mg/sites/default/files/2019-01/Ecoplate-Version-Courte.pdf)\n\n## isolation of soil microrganisms\n\n- **Isolation of Fungal Strains** from Soil Samples: Solid potato dextrose agar (PDA) media were used for the isolation and identification of fungal strains. The inoculum prepared from soil samples was spread on PDA medium, and incubation was carried out at 28 ± 2°C for 5 to 7 days. After incubation, the morphology of the colonies was recorded to identify the specific fungus collected in each sample (ref) [https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/10/6/1280].\nFor bacteria: Starch casien agar(https://www.nature.com/articles/202928a0).\nWe prepared a mineral solution composed of 2 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 4 g/L KH2PO4, 6 g/L Na2HPO4, 0.05 g/L CaCl.2H2O,\n0.2 g/L MgSO4.7H2O, and 0.01 g/L FeSO4.7H2O (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-016-2789-z).\n\n\n### Ecoplate \nAccording to So et al., the EcoPlates™ test, especially when applied to soil, can be challenging to replicate and standardize due to the lack of detailed procedures and protocols. The main issues with this technique primarily concern soil preparation, bacterial inoculum densities, and the correct definition of the reference value (blank) when calculating diversity indices. Based on our previous research in agricultural soils, we propose a standardized and precise step-by-step method for assessing the functional diversity of a soil bacterial community using Biolog® EcoPlates (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/4035).\n\nWe prepared 1:100 dilutions from 10 g subsamples, inoculated the EcoPlate with these diluted subsamples, incubated the plates at in situ temperature, and made measurements on Days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. The first step was to inoculate samples into an EcoPlate, either as aqueous samples or after suspension. The utilization of each carbon source during incubation was coupled to the conversion of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to triphenyl formazan (TPF), so that carbon utilization could be quantified by the color density of TPF in each well using the optical density at 590 nm with a microplate reader (iMark; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Detailed information on EcoPlate, including the 31 carbon substrates, is available at https://www.biolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/00A-012-rD-EcoPlate-IFU.pdf (last accessed on November 9, 2021). [Correction added on 3 March 2022, after first online publication: information about the microplate reader was amended in the preceding paragraph]\n\nDue to its small volume (100 μl/well), the community size can be less than 10,000 individuals/well, which is a nonnegligible source of stochasticity in the initial species composition among the 96 wells in a plate. This could result in variation in color density among identical substrates within a plate (Zhou et al., 2013). To reduce the stochastic effect, three repeated sets of 31 different response wells were conducted for each plot (https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1440-1703.12293). \n\n_Protocol _ \n\n1.\tMeasure 10 g of the soil sample.\n2.\tAdd 10 ml of distilled water and gently shake the flask.\"\n3.\tInoculate the ecoplate with 100 µL for each well.\"\n4.\tIncubate plates at 37°C.\"\n5.\tRead at 590 nm on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14.\n\n\n\n\n### Experimental design of microcosmics project \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n- Preliminary microcosm optimization step\n\n_Preparation of Microcosms\n_We do not have data on the lab's microcosm resistance duration. Therefore, we have created three different batches of 200 grams of soil. The first batch (control) consists of soil sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C for one hour. The second microcosm, called the natural microcosm, underwent no modifications. The last type is the microcosm enriched with a mineral solution to maintain the basic metabolism of the microcosm and promote the growth of slow-growing microorganisms, as shown in the experimental plan in Figure 1. Each of these three types of microcosms will be replicated four times, giving us a total of twelve microcosms for measurements after 1 week, 15 days, 21 days, and 30 days. All microcosms were incubated at 28 °C. All components used for the microcosms were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 minutes at 121 C.\n\n_Sterilization of soil_ \n\nSoil is autoclaved at 121°C during 1h (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167701296008433)\n_Samling site _\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/Ch9ccDJaAidT1GxR8\n\n\n\n- First screening of extraction methods\n\nIn the first step, we optimized the soil metabolome extraction protocol. To achieve this, we extracted 5 grams of soil using five extraction methods: M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5. Subsequently, the mixtures were allowed to rest for 2 hours, after which they underwent sonication at 37 kHz with a 100-pulse wave for 30 minutes at a temperature range of 30-60°C. Following this, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000× g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and stored at -20°C for further analysis.\nMethod 1: 100% methanol.\nMethod 2: 80%,20%, 0.01% (Methanol/ H2O/Formic acid).\nMethod 3: 100% DMSO.\nMethod 4: 4ml of ammonium bicarbonate + 10 ml methanol+ 5ml of chloroform.\nMethod 5: 4ml of ammonium bicarbonate + 10 ml ethyl acetate.\nAll the extractions have a final volume of 15 ml with 5 g of soil.\nAdditionally, 0.5 grams of the sample were diluted in 4 milliliters of sterile distilled water and vigorously shaken. A volume of 100 μL of the diluted sample was inoculated onto various culture media, including SCA supplemented with antimicrobials (nalidixic acid, cycloheximide, and nystatin), PDA, nutrient agar, and A4. The plates were incubated at 28°C, except for those inoculated on nutrient agar, which were incubated at 37°C.\n\n##### comments after applying\n\nthe five methods are not coonslusive - the search for other methods is essential. Weak profiles\n\n     - Others etraction methods: \n\n1. The 45 collected soil samples, and 5 blank samples containing no\nsoil, were lyophilized on an Edwards Super Modulyo freeze-drier (SciQuip Ltd., Shropshire, UK) for 7 d. Subsequently, these were ground in a Retsch MM200 stainless steel ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany)\nat a frequency of 20 Hz to aid recovery of metabolites from the microbial biomass (Fiehn et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2015). The samples were then stored in individual sterile glass vials at  -80°C to minimize changes in metabolites (Wellerdiek et al., 2009). The soils were extracted using 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile-isopropanol-water, vortexed for 15 s, shakenat 4° C for 5 min, centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 2 min, and dried using a CentriVap Benchtop Centrifugal Concentrator (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO) (Barupal et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2019). Non-targeted primary metabolism analysis was performed using a Gerstel Automated Linear Exchange-Cold Injection System (ALEX-CIS) with Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) and Leco Pegasus IV Time Of Flight (TOF) MS at the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Facility using the method of Fiehn (2016). Briefly, 0.5 μl of each sample was injected onto a Rtx-5Sil MS capillary column (30 m length ° 0.25 m i.d with 10 m integrated guard column; 0.25 μm 95% dimethylsiloxane/5% diphenylpolysiloxane coating; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA). Using a He mobile phase, the GC thermal programme was 50 °C for 1 min, ramped to 330°C at 20° C min 1 and finally held at 330 °C for 5 min. Upon elution, samples were injected into a Pegasus IV GC-time of flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI), using mass resolution of 17 spectra s1 , from 80 to 500 Da, at  70 eV ionization energy and 1800 V detector voltage with a 230 °C transfer line and 250°C ion source [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107758]].\n\n    -- _Protocol steps_\n     - Lyophilization of the samples for 7 days.\n     -Grinding in a stainless steel ball mill Retsch at a frequency of 20 Hz.\n     -The samples were then stored in individual sterile glass vials at -80°C.\n     -The soils were extracted using a 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile-isopropanol-water solution. The mixture was vortexed for 15 seconds, shaken at 4°C for 5 minutes, and then centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 2 minutes. Finally, the samples were dried using a CentriVap Benchtop CentriVap.\n2. Prior to use, all glassware was acid-washed (5% HCl, > 24 h) to remove chemical residues, rinsed in HPLC-grade water three times, and subsequently dry heat sterilised (150 °C, 2.5 h) (Jain et al., 2020). All equipment used to process the soil (e.g., tweezers and spatulas) were thoroughly cleaned both before and between samples with deionised water and 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS) to prevent cross-contamination. Nutrients in the concentrations described in section 2.2 were added by pipette in 1 ml of HPLC-plus grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) evenly distributed across the surface of **10 g fresh weight of soil** in 240 ml polypropylene sample containers (Snap-Seal®; Corning, NY, USA). This type of container was used to ensure even coverage of the soil surface with the nutrient solution (soil depth ca. 10 mm). Five independent soil replicates (n = 5) were set up per treatment. Samples were subsequently incubated as described in Section 2.2. At the end of the incubation period, the **soil samples were immediately transferred to 20 ml glass vials and fumigated with ethanol-free chloroform for 24 h** to lyse microbial cells, to increase metabolite yield (Swenson et al., 2015) and limit microbial processing of metabolites, using the method of Vance et al. (1987). After fumigation, samples **were immediately frozen (−80 °C) to quench any residual metabolic and enzymatic activity** (Wellerdiek et al., 2009). From this point onwards, all samples were stored at −80 °C, unless otherwise stated and while being processed (i.e. out of the freezer), samples were kept on ice (4 °C). L**yophilisation of samples (>24 h) was then performed** using a Modulyo Freeze Dryer (ThermoFisher Corp, Waltham, MA) equipped with an RV vacuum pump (Edwards Ltd., Crawley, UK). S**amples were then mechanically ground using a Retsch MM200** stainless steel ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) **for 60 s at a frequency of 20 Hz** to aid in cell lysis and metabolite recovery and to increase sample homogeneity (Wang et al., 2015; Withers et al., 2020). The ball mill was cleaned thoroughly between samples with HPLC-grade water followed by 70% IMS, to avoid contamination.\nThe following extraction method is based on the hybridised methods of Swenson et al. (2015) and Fiehn et al. (2008). Briefly, we used the extraction method from Swenson et al. (2015) and the solvent makeup (3:3:2) from Fiehn et al. (2008), to ensure broad metabolite coverage, with the recovery of both polar and non-polar metabolite classes. Further, the weight of soil extracted was increased in order to maximise the volume of supernatant available for lyophilisation and subsequent analysis. A pre-experiment was used to compare the efficiency of the metabolite extraction method proposed here to that of the Swenson et al. (2015) method (the results are summarised in supplementary information Section S1).\n\nUpon soil extraction, **6 g of each fumigated, lyophilised**, **ground soil sample was weighed into a 35 ml glass centrifuge tub**e (Kimax®; DWK Life Sciences, Stoke-on-Trent, UK), **to which 24 ml of pre-cooled (−20 °C) acetonitrile (MeCN)/isopropyl alcohol (IPA)/HPLC-plus grade water (H2O) (3:3:2 v/v/v) extractant was added**, using a glass pipette. Samples were then **horizontally shaken on ice (4 °C) at a frequency of 200 Hz for 1 h**, and then c**entrifuged at 3320×g for 15 min** (Swenson et al., 2015). S**upernatants were then transferred**, using glass pipettes, into **20 ml glass vials and stored at −20 °C** (to ensure metabolic activity was quenched but the supernatant was not frozen). Samples were left unfiltered due to the potential of contamination from dissolution of contaminants from the filter paper and plastic housing. **The supernatant was lyophilised in 2 ml glass vials** using a Modulyo Freeze Dryer with RV pump attached to a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator (Savant; ThermoFisher Corp.). **The vials were periodically topped up with the supernatant, taking note of the quantity added (∼15 ml total) and lyophilised to complete dryness.** Samples **were then shipped on dry ice (−78.5 °C)** to Metabolon Inc. (Morrisville, North Carolina, USA) for untargeted LC-MS metabolomic analysis. Upon analysis, **samples were dissolved in methanol:water (4:1 v/v) and subjected to the standard Metabolon sample preparation procedure.** Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis parameters, bioinformatics, compound ID and data curation are summarised in Supplementary information Section S2 [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003807172200236X]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Composition of culture media, prepared solution supplemented, and chemicals used in the experimental section \n\n_Culture media and solutions_\nStarch casein agar\nsoluble starch: 10 g\n K2HPO4: 2 g\n KNO3: 2 g\nCasein: 0.3 g, \nMgSO4.7H2O 0.05 g\n CaCO3: 0.02 g\n FeSO4.7H2O: 0.01 g\nAgar: 15 g \n_Mineral medium (g/L)_\n(NH)2SO4:  \nKH2PO4, 4\nNa2HPO4:  6;\nMgSO4. 7H2O: 0.2\nCaC12 .2H2O: 0.001 \nFeSO4 - 7 H2O: 0.001\npH 7.5.\n\n\n### you have to do tomorrow \n\n1.

It is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care \\(including care of offspring from other individuals\\), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society, sometimes called castes. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform behaviors characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusocial colonies can be viewed as superorganisms.\nEusociality has evolved among the insects, crustaceans, trematoda and mammals. It is most widespread in the Hymenoptera \\(ants, bees, and wasps\\) and in Blattodea \\(termites\\). A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create and maintain a living situation favorable for the brood. Queens produce multiple queen pheromones to create and maintain the eusocial state in their colonies; they may also eat eggs laid by other females or exert dominance by fighting. There are two eusocial rodents: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat. Some shrimps, such as Synalpheus regalis, are eusocial. E. O. Wilson and others have claimed that humans have evolved a weak form of eusociality.

The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon.Originally, operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes \\(which includes organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria\\), but their discovery in eukaryotes was shown in the early 1990s, and are considered to be rare. In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs.\nOperons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two operons. The first operon codes for various products, including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon. The second operon includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.\")\n\n\nMITE minimum information about a tailoring enzyme/maturase\n\n\nDuring this meeting, we will inform you about the scope and focus of the annotathons, some organizational improvements, and our upcoming MIBiG Online Submission system. We will also discuss the new roles of Coordinators and Reviewers in detail. Make sure to tune in!\n\nWe also want to announce the dates of the annotathons. Please bear in mind that for co-authorship on the next MIBiG publication, participation in at least two 3-hour annotathon sessions (or an equivalent contribution) is necessary. The MIBiG annotathon dates are:\n\n    • March 19th 7 am – 10 pm and 4 pm – 7 pm (GMT)\n    • April 23rd 7 am – 10 pm and 4 pm – 7 pm (GMT)\n    • May 14th 7 am – 10 pm and 4 pm – 7 pm (GMT)\n\nFurther, we want to make a call for contributions to our MIBiG Literature table (http://tinyurl.com/mibig-literature). In this table, we are collecting recent publications on biosynthetic gene cluster that are currently missing in the MIBiG database, but also publications that report additional information on already existing MIBiG entries. This collection of publications will be used as a starting point during the annotathons. If you have publications that you want to see covered during the annotathons, please feel free to add them to the table. We have prepared an explanatory document in case of any uncertainties (http://tinyurl.com/mibig-literature-explanation). \n\nColleagues who have indicated to be interested in acting as Coordinators or Reviewers will receive an additional email about these roles in the next few days.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcome you at the Kickoff meetings!\n\nKind regards, \n\nMarnix Medema, Mitja Zdouc, and the MIBiG team\n\n\nThey mention the https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n\n\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- o","n":0.04}}},{"i":164,"$":{"0":{"v":"2024-02-19","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.\n\nToday is 2024.02.19\n\n## Todo today\n\n### Have a look at the COMMONS research discussion forum\n    - https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/discussions\n\n### Daily work on the Open Science for natural products research Viewpoint\n\nSee [[viewpoint]]\n\n\n###\n###\n\n## Doing\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n\n\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- Cmd+shift+L flags/un-flags an mail in Mail (MacOS)\n- https://github.com/mikefarah/yq is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON and XML processor. yq uses jq like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json, xml, properties, csv and tsv.

These methods should not involve automated learning.\nChatGPT\nConstructing or inferring a full image from partial inputs without involving automated learning can be challenging, as it typically requires complex computational algorithms or manual interventions. However, there are a few methods that can be used to reconstruct or expand a full image from partial inputs without relying on automated learning. Here are a few approaches:\n\nPatch-based methods: In this approach, the partial inputs or patches are analyzed individually, and then these patches are combined or stitched together to form the full image. This method requires a prior understanding of the spatial relationships between patches. Various algorithms, such as graph cuts or seam carving, can be used to combine the patches effectively.\n\nImage inpainting techniques: Image inpainting aims to fill in missing or occluded regions in an image. By applying inpainting algorithms, you can reconstruct the missing parts of the image based on the surrounding information or by propagating the existing image content. Techniques like texture synthesis, diffusion-based methods, or exemplar-based approaches can be used for image inpainting.\n\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM): SfM is a technique used to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D image sequences. If you have partial inputs from different viewpoints or angles, you can use SfM algorithms to estimate the camera poses and 3D structure of the scene. By combining the reconstructed 3D information, you can generate a full image or a more complete representation of the scene.\n\nImage completion with manual interventions: If automated learning is not allowed, manual interventions can be used to complete or expand an image from partial inputs. This approach involves human interaction or expertise to fill in missing details or to infer the complete image based on the available information. Tools like image editing software can be employed to manually paint or draw missing parts of the image.\n\nIt's important to note that these methods may require some level of computational algorithms or techniques, but they do not rely on automated learning specifically. Instead, they involve manual interventions or computational procedures that do not involve training on large datasets.\n\n\n\nLet's say that this patchy dataset is a table of occurence of molecules within living organisms. We thus have phylogenetic relationshsips across the organisms and chemical class taxonomy across the molecules. What approch would you propose to reconstruct a full dataset from a patchy dataset ?\nChatGPT\nIn the case of a patchy dataset representing the occurrence of molecules within living organisms, where phylogenetic relationships across organisms and chemical class taxonomy across molecules are known, you can leverage these relationships to reconstruct a more complete dataset. Here's an approach you can consider:\n\nPhylogenetic imputation: Given the phylogenetic relationships among organisms, you can utilize this information to infer missing values in the dataset. This approach assumes that closely related organisms have similar characteristics, including the occurrence of molecules. You can estimate missing values by propagating the observed data from closely related organisms to fill in the gaps in less studied or missing organisms.\n\nChemical class-based imputation: If you have a taxonomy of chemical classes for the molecules, you can use this information to infer missing values. Explore the chemical classes present in the dataset and their relationships to impute missing occurrences based on the patterns observed within each class. This could involve considering the distribution of occurrences within a chemical class or using statistical measures within specific chemical class groups.\n\nCross-validation: To enhance the reliability of the reconstructed dataset, you can perform cross-validation techniques. Split the available data into training and testing sets and use the known data to impute the missing values in the testing set. Then compare the imputed values with the actual values to evaluate the accuracy and adjust the imputation method if necessary.\n\nExpert validation: Given the complexity and domain-specific nature of the dataset, it is valuable to involve experts in the field. Experts can provide insights, validate the reconstructed dataset, and refine the imputation process based on their knowledge of the organisms, molecules, and their interactions.\n\nIt's important to note that imputation methods rely on assumptions and might introduce some level of uncertainty. The quality and accuracy of the reconstructed dataset will depend on the availability and quality of the existing data, the accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships and chemical class taxonomy, and the effectiveness of the imputation methods employed.\n\nOverall, combining phylogenetic relationships, chemical class taxonomy, statistical imputation, and expert input can help you reconstruct a more complete dataset of molecule occurrences within living organisms.\n\n\n\nGreat. Would their be an approach that could combine both the Phylogenetic imputation and the Chemical class-based imputation ? That is a method which would exploit the structure on both dimension of the datset for the inputation \nChatGPT\nYes, it is indeed possible to combine both phylogenetic imputation and chemical class-based imputation to exploit the structure on both dimensions of the dataset for imputation. Here's an approach that combines these two methods:\n\nPhylogenetic imputation: Use the phylogenetic relationships among organisms to propagate information and impute missing values. Start by identifying closely related organisms with available data. For each missing value, find the closest related organisms with observed data and use their values as a basis for imputation. This imputation process takes into account the assumption that closely related organisms share similar characteristics, including the occurrence of molecules.\n\nChemical class-based imputation: Leverage the chemical class taxonomy to further refine the imputation process. Within each chemical class, observe the distribution of occurrences and utilize statistical measures such as mean, median, or mode to estimate missing values. Consider the patterns and tendencies within each chemical class while imputing missing values.\n\nCombination and refinement: Combine the imputed values from the phylogenetic imputation and chemical class-based imputation approaches. This can be achieved by assigning weights or merging the imputed values based on the confidence or reliability of each approach. You can also consider using statistical techniques such as ensemble methods or weighted averaging to combine the imputations effectively.\n\nExpert validation: As mentioned before, involving domain experts in the validation process is crucial. Experts can provide insights on the reliability and biological plausibility of the imputed values. They can also suggest adjustments or refinements to the imputation process based on their knowledge of the organisms, molecules, and their relationships.\n\nBy combining phylogenetic imputation with chemical class-based imputation, you leverage both the phylogenetic relationships among organisms and the chemical class taxonomy of molecules to impute missing values. This approach takes advantage of the structural information present in both dimensions of the dataset, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate imputation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n\n\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- ","n":0.028}}},{"i":202,"$":{"0":{"v":"2023-05-12","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.\n\nToday is 2023.05.12\n\n## Todo today\n\n### Have a look at the COMMONS research discussion forum\n    - https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/discussions\n###\n###\n\n## Doing\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo tomorrow, one day ... or never \n\n\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- To open a new instance of chromium I need to\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/35414\n\nchromium --user-data-dir=$(mktemp -d)","n":0.139}}},{"i":203,"$":{"0":{"v":"2023-05-08","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.\n\nToday is 2023.05.08\n\n## Todo today\n\n### Have a look at the COMMONS research discussion forum\n    - https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/discussions\n###\n###\n\n## Doing\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\n\n## Notes\n\n### Getting more info on the recurrent ‘Solving environment: failed with initial frozen solve.

This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn, as well as to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn.Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin also appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding, its use by the mother during the first two weeks of life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family of antibiotics and works by decreasing bacterial protein production.Erythromycin was first isolated in 1952 from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 225th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions.\")\n\n\n\n\n[France](Q142 \"Q142\")\n\n\n[Erythromycin](Q213511 \"Q213511\")\n\n\n[Aspirin](Q18216 \"medication used to treat pain and decrease the risk of heart disease\")\n\n[Salix alba](Q156918 \"species of plant\")\n\n\n\n[Salix alba](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q156918 \"species of plant\")\n\nQ1\n\nQ1\n\nuniverse\n\nTrying to adapt the wikipedia VScode extension so it handles wd also\n\n## Original url\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbgetentities&sites=enwiki&titles=Erythromycin&props=descriptions&languages=en&format=json\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=info|extracts&exintro&explaintext&&inprop=url&redirects=1&titles=Erythromycin\n\n## Modified\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=info|extracts&exintro&explaintext&&inprop=url&redirects=1&titles=Erythromycin\n\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=info|extracts&exintro&explaintext&&inprop=url&redirects=1&titles=keanumycin\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbgetentities&sites=enwiki&titles=Erythromycin&props=descriptions&languages=en&format=json\n\n\n\n[Keanumycin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116980169 \"class of chemical compounds\")\n\n\n[Keanumycin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116980169 \"class of chemical compounds\") A\n\nQ116980169\n\n\n[Keanumycin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116980169 \"class of chemical compounds\")n](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q116980169 \"class of chemical compounds\")\n\n\n[aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin \"Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid \\(ASA\\), is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug \\(NSAID\\) used to reduce pain, fever, and\\/or inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.One common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.A precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree \\(genus Salix\\) has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. Over the next 50 years, other chemists established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods.: 69–75 Aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions. It is one of the most widely used medications globally, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes \\(44,000 tons\\) \\(50 to 120 billion pills\\) consumed each year, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

This is garanteed to converge to correct marginals but it is wasteful. There is an other way : \"collect and distribute schedule\". The idea is to pick one node as the \"root\" fo the tree, find all the leaves of the graph and compute messages to their parents. Continue until you reach the root. **If the graph is a tree, any node can be a root.** We then backpropagate back to the leaves. Advantage : we only do one update per message.  See explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBWAboEWQk) at 11min34sec. This is very similar to an HMM and its forward-backward algorithm. \n\nNow the problem for our model is that we have to combine two trees. The one from species and the one from molecules. We could think of each node as a combination of each molecule with each species. \n## Todo today\n* look definition of loopy back propagation. \n* Check out [this blog](https://medium.com/@philipyunsoocho/image-denoising-by-gibbs-sampling-67d1ad3d7344).

In fact, we should have a product between the values of the covariances matrices and not a sum. For example, if I take two species that have 0 correlation and one molecule. Does having that molecule in one of the species give me any additional information about the presence of that molecule in the other species ? Other than the average presence $\\mu$ NO we can't have any other information ! \n\nWe thus have $$cov(\\epsilon_c, \\epsilon_{c'}) = \\prod_t \\prod_{f=1}^{F_t} \\sigma_{tf}(\\tau_t(c), \\tau_t(c')^{\\alpha_{tf}})$$\n\nFurthermore, in order to reduce the variance covariance matrix, we first assume that a lot of molecules and a lot of species share no correlation. This, in theory, would allow us to split the data **before** creating the cov matrix of molecules and the cov matrix of species. This would imply to assume that some molecules and some species share 0 covariance.\n\n![image](assets/images/2023-04-24-17-14-46.jpg)\n\n## Todo today\n* \n\n## Doing\n\n\n## Done\n* \n\n\n## Todo tomorrow\n ","n":0.076}}},{"i":235,"$":{"0":{"v":"2023-04-24","n":1},"1":{"v":"# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.\n\nToday is 2023.04.24\n\n\n## Notes\n\n## Todo today\n* \n\n## Doing\n\n\n## Done\n* Discussion with Daniel about new approach.

We denote by $x_{sm}$ whether metabolite $m=1,\\ldots,M$ is present ($x_{sm}=1$) or absent ($x_{sm}=0$) in species $s=1,\\ldots,S$. To infer the full vector $\\bm{x}=(x_{11}, \\ldots, x_{1M},\\ldots,x_{SM})$, we assume that related species share a similar set of metabolites and that metabolites related in their synthesis share a similar distribution across species. \nLet ${\\mathbb P}(x_{sm}=1|y_{sm})=y_{sm}$ be the probability with which metabolite $m$ is present in species $s$. We then assume that\n\n$$\nlogit \\space y_{sm} = log \\frac{y_{sm}}{1-y_{sm}} = \\mu_m + \\epsilon_{sm}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is a metabolite-specific intercept and $\\epsilon_{sm}$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and co-variance $cov(\\epsilon_{sm},\\epsilon_{s'm'})=\\alpha \\sigma_{ss'} + \\beta \\sigma_{mm'}$ between each combination of species and metabolite. Here, $\\sigma_{ss'}$ and $\\sigma_{mm'}$ are known measures of covariance between species $s$ and $s'$ and between metabolites $m$ and $m'$, respectively, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive scalars.\n\nWe consider two sets of data informative about $\\bm{x}$: i) Presence-absence data obtained with mass-spectrometry and ii) presence-only reports of specific metabolites in specific specie. Let $\\bm{d_{sj}}=(d_{sj1}, \\ldots, d_{sjM})$ be the presence-absence vector of each metabolite $m$ obtained with mass-spectrometry run $j=1,\\ldots,J_s$ performed on species $s$. Assuming a false-positive and false-negative error rates $\\epsilon_{01}$ and $\\epsilon_{10}$, respectively, we have\n\n$$\n{\\mathbb P}(\\bm{d_{sj}}|\\bm{x}, \\epsilon_{01}, \\epsilon_{10}) = \\prod_m \\left[ x_{sm}\\left(\\epsilon_{10}^{1-d_{sjm}}(1-\\epsilon_{10})^{d_{sjm}}\\right) + (1-x_{sm})\\left( \\epsilon_{01}^{d_{sjm}}(1-\\epsilon_{01})^{1-d_{sjm}}\\right)\\right].\n$$\n\nTo model the presence only data, it must be put in relation to the expected research effort. Let $p_{sm}$ denote the known number of presence-only reports for metabolite $m$ in species $s$ and $n_{sm}$ the unknown number of research projects that aimed at discovering metabolite $m$ in species $s$. Assuming a false-positive and false-negative error rates $\\pi_{01}$ and $\\pi_{10}$, respectively, we have\n\n$$\n{\\mathbb P}(p_{sm}|n_{sm}, \\pi_{01}, \\pi_{10}) = ...\n$$\n\n\nProduct of cov ?! and not the sum ? \n### Images\nHere are the first ideas of the discussion we had with Daniel and Pierre-Marie:\n\n![image](assets/images/2023-01-30-14-53-54.jpg)\n\n![image](assets/images/2023-01-30-14-53-55.jpg)\n### Ideas \nSee forum discussion [here](https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/forum/discussions/3)\n* The probability of occurence of a given chemical class (i.e of a pseudo absence being indeed pseudo an not a real absence) could be formulated as the sum of probability of this occurence given the : chemical research effort context, phylogenetic context, covariance of other chemical classes. \n* This last term was discussed: study of the covariance of chemical classes within a given taxa could be informative. \n###\n\n## Doing\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\nChange `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R` in order to have a csv table and not a space separated data. \n\n## Notes\n\"ref/noref, children/nochildren\" mean if you take into account multiple reference (and children) or not.\n\nSo, for example: 2 articles report amarogentin in *Gentiana lutea*, 3 (of which 1 is the same) in *Gentiana acaulis*.\n\nThen, for the pair amarogentin in *Gentiana*:\n* `ref_child` : 5 &rarr; Gives the number of occurences were we find amarogentin related with a *Gentiana* species.\n* `ref_nochild`: 4 &rarr; Gives how many **different** papers there are that talk about amarogentin in the species *Gentiana*\n* `noref_child` : 2 &rarr; Gives how many children of that species were found with at least one reference (in that case : *Gentiana    \n  lutea* and *Gentiana acaulis*)\n* `noref_nochild`: 1 &rarr; Will only be either 0 or 1. Gives if it there is at least one reference that talks about that molecule \n  in the species *Gentiana*\n\n**ATTENTION** tables are grouped also chemically. So child also refers to the \"chemical children\", so exactly same principle as for *Gentiana* and *G. lutea* but this for Terpenoids > Monoterpenoids > Secoiridoids (> Amarogentin)... \n## Todo tomorrow\n\n###\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- ","n":0.042}}},{"i":253,"$":{"0":{"v":"2023-02-09","n":1},"1":{"v":"# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.\n\nToday is 2023.02.09\n\n## Todo today\n\n### Have a look at the DBGI discussion forum\n* https://github.com/orgs/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/discussions\n\n\n###\n###\n\n## Doing\n* comment code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees\n  * `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`\n  * `prettyStructuresTable.R`\n  * `prettyTree.R`\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\nCommented code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees : \n* `count_npclasses.R`\n* `papers_taxa_correlation.R`\n\n## Notes\n### Scripts descrition\nI think the most important script for us is `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`.

This reduces the amount of data read and processed.\n\nIndexing:\nWhile DuckDB itself doesn't require traditional indexing, ensuring your Parquet files are partitioned appropriately based on the columns you frequently query can improve performance.\n\nEfficient Storage:\nEnsure your Parquet files are optimized for storage, using appropriate compression (like Snappy or ZSTD) and columnar storage formats.\n\nMemory Management:\nDuckDB operates in-memory, so ensure your system has sufficient RAM to handle the dataset. If your dataset is too large to fit into memory, consider processing it in chunks.\n\n\n\nexplanation of rules:\npkr0000001\t\t(1) http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q278809[c0].(1) PHOSPHATE_ACCEPTOR_CoF[c0].(1) Pi[c0]>>(1) pkc0000111[c0].(1) pkc0000312[c0].(1) PYROPHOSPHATE_DONOR_CoF[c0]\tC=C(C)C1CC=C(C)CC1.O=P(O)(O)O.Nc1ncnc2c1ncn2C1OC(COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)C(O)C1O>>C.C=C(O)C1CC=C(C)CC1.Nc1ncnc2c1ncn2C1OC(COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)C(O)C1O\tR0018d5c11a521de93fc329868fe7e99b660898ffef935a146d044e31a2d9d40e\trule0402\n\nrule0402\tAny;PHOSPHATE_ACCEPTOR_CoF;Pi\t[#6:1]-[#6:2].[#8:3].[#8:4]-[#15:5]>>[#6:1].[#6:2]-[#8:4].[#8:3]-[#15:5]\tAny;Any;PHOSPHATE_DONOR_CoF\tA4YD22;A4YD23;A4YGI1;A9WEI4;A9WKJ2;O17732;O24789;O27179;O27939;O30019;O93918;P05165;P05166;P07633;P11154;P11498;P14882;P32327;P34385;P52873;P53002;P53003;P54541;P63408;P78992;P79384;P81185;P95127;P9WQH4;P9WQH5;P9WQH6;P9WQH7;Q05920;Q06101;Q0CLK1;Q16921;Q19842;Q20676;Q29RK2;Q2QMG2;Q2TBR0;Q3J4D9;Q3J4E3;Q3ULD5;Q40121;Q42523;Q42777;Q54KE6;Q58626;Q58628;Q5I0C3;Q5XIT9;Q612F5;Q6M0D0;Q6M0D1;Q877I3;Q877I4;Q877I5;Q8T2J9;Q8X1T3;Q91ZA3;Q96CX0;Q96RQ3;Q99MN9;Q99MR8;Q9CHQ7;Q9F843;Q9HCC0;Q9HES8;Q9I297;Q9KWU4;Q9LDD8;Q9PNQ4;Q9PP00;Q9UUE1;Q9V9A7;Q9XBJ1\n\nSMART reaction:\nC-C + O* + P-O >> C + O-C + P-O*\n\n1 limonen + Phoshate_acceptor_CoF + pi >> pkc0000111 + pkc0000312 + PYROPHOSPHATE_DONOR_CoF\nC10H16   + C10H16N5O13P3 + H3O4P >> CH4 + C9H14O + C10H16N5O13P3\n\n(1)Q278809 + (1) PHOSPHATE_ACCEPTOR_CoF + (1) Pi>>(1) pkc0000111 + (1) pkc0000312 + (1) PYROPHOSPHATE_DONOR_CoF\nC=C(C)C1CC=C(C)CC1 + O=P(O)(O)O + Nc1ncnc2c1ncn2C1OC(COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)C(O)C1O >> C + C=C(O)C1CC=C(C)CC1 + Nc1ncnc2c1ncn2C1OC(COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)C(O)C1O\n\n\n## Future perspective\n\n\n\n## Keywords\n[[expanded_np_chemspace.abbreviations.md]]\n","n":0.068}}},{"i":274,"$":{"0":{"v":"2024-07-17","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# PAMREIN's daily Open Notebook (COMMONS Lab)\n\n## Todo - [Check Github](https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/projects/2/views/1)\n-[]\n\n\n## Meetings\n\n\n\n## Daily report (What did I learn?)\nStorage vs. rows (what changes with removing duplicates):\n\noriginal\trenamed\t\n52402\t49875\t0.951776649746193\n48531\t45710\t0.94187220539449\n71354\t68697\t0.962763124702189\n    \n    \nrenamed\tcleaned\t\n49875\t\t\n45710\t44294\t0.969022095821483\n68697\t67320\t0.979955456570156\n\n\n\n## Future perspective\n\n\n\n## Keywords\n[[expanded_np_chemspace.abbreviations.md]]\n","n":0.183}}},{"i":275,"$":{"0":{"v":"2024-07-15","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# PAMREIN's daily Open Notebook (COMMONS Lab)\n\n## Todo - [Check Github](https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/projects/2/views/1)\n-[]\n\n\n## Meetings\n\n\n\n## Daily report (What did I learn?)\n\n\n\n## Future perspective\nToday I checked the script for cleaning.

It is possible to reduce 50 Gb to 6 Gb.\nThe thing about *.parquet is, that it is binary (not human readable) and my dates are with the parquet file format still ~120 Gb togheter.\nEven with streaming and loading this huge datasets with the berner cluster (IBU) I run in \"kill\", which result in a OOM (out of memory).\n\nparquet: column oriented storage with a self-describing header (metadata). It was introduced 2013 by <https://parquet.apache.org/> which   is an opensource project.\n          compression is done columne wise and can be stored as a binary. It uses also RLE (Run length encoding) which saves multiple occurences of words only ones with a index.\n          parquet format can be read from multiple dataanalytic tools and is not only smaller in storagespace, but also in read & save speed.\n          good to know: Parquet files can be a zip bomb. so be carefull to read in parquet files (if possible, set max limits.)\n\n- DuckDB can use parquet files. (https://duckdb.org/2024/03/26/42-parquet-a-zip-bomb-for-the-big-data-age.html)\n\nfor big data processing they speak from dask or spark. Dask is in general less heavy and faster. It get public 2014 and spark 2010. ^uapatuqa2w46\n\n\n> Which are the \"intresting questions\" for this dataset?\nMy interpretation of the questions who can be answered with this datset, if the possibility exist, that a specific molecule exist in a choosen organism.\nFor example: If we analyse bacetrias thuringensis and we found in the MS spectra an unknown peak (untargeted). When we kind of can reconstruct the molecule, so we can search in our database and try to find it. If yes, we can check, in which organism it is known...\n\n\n\n\ntest run 1#:\npolars: shape: (7_431, 8)\nstart time: 1718883014.44sec    read_in_time: 0.05sec   filtered_time: 0.01sec         show_time: 516.50sec\n\ntest run 2#:\npolars: shape: (14_862, 8)\nread_in_time: 4.60sec   filtered_time: 1718883699.48sec         show_time: 4849.37sec\n\nI had a small error in my script.

This what we have to do with our fork. \n- Somehow, it didn't worked. The solution was to rename the mainfolder minedatabase -> mine_database. Additionaly we had to run `poetry build` in the folder, to make kind of a package out of it. With poetry show, we could see it added the package which was not from pipy. \n- I realised, when I installing packages, they will be also available for pyenv. Better said, poetry uses pyenv for this. The problem is, that I have multiple packages working on that pyenv...

It was invented by George H. Fisher of the Space Sciences Lab at UC Berkeley in 2007.  \nThe format's goal was to provide a way of reading and writing output data from numerical simulations that preserve full precision. Furthermore, the format is simple, easy to use, and supports files of several gigabytes.\n\n \n\nfor request commands like *GET and *POST we should always raise an error, if the status has some problems...\n`r.raise_for_status()`   \nThe *GET and *POST is for communication with a server. *GET is for requesting data from a server and *POST is for submitting data to a server.

Somehow I have to provide a name of the file, but I don't get it, how I would get the filename without knowing it. If I try the querys directly in the browser, I can see there is only one file to download. The package also needs the API_token, which doesn't makes it userfriendly.\nI will try to find another solution for it. \n\n\n### Webscrapping\nIt didn't worked out with the zenodo_client, so I tried to do it with webscrapping. I used beautifulsoup4 and selenium to get the links.\nThe trick is, to open a webpage where all the versions are available, load them (javascript is activ what makes it more difficult to grap)\nand get the links for downloading. I tried to build my own package, but it didn't worked out until now. So I will do it in the next days.\n\nI learned a lot about webscrapping basics and some nice coding.

One for molecularweight (MV) and one for atomic composition of an individual compound to determine if it should be removed\nfrom the network.\n- Pickaxe generates cemical fingerprints (bit vectores with the RDKit) for see similarities. It has a cutoff filter and sampling filter (weighted Tanimoto distribution)\n- With the Metabolomics filter needs as input a list of experimental mass-to-charge (m/z) values and a list of possible adducts.\n- Thermodynamics-based filter uses the Gibbs free energy. \n- Feasibility filter: Deep learning-based Reaction Feasibility Checker (Deep_RFC). It is incorporated into Pickaxe.\n- Outputs: generated networks in three different formats. Each format has information about the compounds: reactions, reactionrules and target molecules.\nResults can be stored in a MongoDB as a JSON format.

As such, they are critical to the evolution of modern science, in which the work of one scientist builds upon that of others. To reach their goal, papers must aim to inform, not impress. They must be highly readable — that is, clear, accurate, and concise. They are more likely to be cited by other scientists if they are helpful rather than cryptic or self-centered.\n\nScientific papers typically have two audiences: first, the referees, who help the journal editor decide whether a paper is suitable for publication; and second, the journal readers themselves, who may be more or less knowledgeable about the topic addressed in the paper. To be accepted by referees and cited by readers, papers must do more than simply present a chronological account of the research work. Rather, they must convince their audience that the research presented is important, valid, and relevant to other scientists in the same field. To this end, they must emphasize both the motivation for the work and the outcome of it, and they must include just enough evidence to establish the validity of this outcome.\n\nPapers that report experimental work are often structured chronologically in five sections: first, Introduction; then Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion (together, these three sections make up the paper's body); and finally, Conclusion.\n\nThe Introduction section clarifies the motivation for the work presented and prepares readers for the structure of the paper.\nThe Materials and Methods section provides sufficient detail for other scientists to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. In some journals, this information is placed in an appendix, because it is not what most readers want to know first.\nThe Results and Discussion sections present and discuss the research results, respectively. They are often usefully combined into one section, however, because readers can seldom make sense of results alone without accompanying interpretation — they need to be told what the results mean.\nThe Conclusion section presents the outcome of the work by interpreting the findings at a higher level of abstraction than the Discussion and by relating these findings to the motivation stated in the Introduction.\n(Papers reporting something other than experiments, such as a new method or technology, typically have different sections in their body, but they include the same Introduction and Conclusion sections as described above.)\n\nAlthough the above structure reflects the progression of most research projects, effective papers typically break the chronology in at least three ways to present their content in the order in which the audience will most likely want to read it. First and foremost, they summarize the motivation for, and the outcome of, the work in an abstract, located before the Introduction. In a sense, they reveal the beginning and end of the story — briefly — before providing the full story. Second, they move the more detailed, less important parts of the body to the end of the paper in one or more appendices so that these parts do not stand in the readers' way. Finally, they structure the content in the body in theorem-proof fashion, stating first what readers must remember (for example, as the first sentence of a paragraph) and then presenting evidence to support this statement.\n\n## The introduction\n\n\n View Full-Size Image An effective introduction for a paper\n\nThe introduction reproduced here exhibits the four components that readers find useful as they begin to read a paper.\nIn the Introduction section, state the motivation for the work presented in your paper and prepare readers for the structure of the paper. Write four components, probably (but not necessarily) in four paragraphs: context, need, task, and object of the document.\n* First, provide some context to orient those readers who are less familiar with your topic and to establish the importance of your work.\n* Second, state the need for your work, as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it wants.\n* Third, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n* Finally, preview the remainder of the paper to mentally prepare readers for its structure, in the object of the document.\n\n### Context and need\n\nAt the beginning of the Introduction section, the context and need work together as a funnel: They start broad and progressively narrow down to the issue addressed in the paper. To spark interest among your audience — referees and journal readers alike — provide a compelling motivation for the work presented in your paper: The fact that a phenomenon has never been studied before is not, in and of itself, a reason to study that phenomenon.\n\nWrite the context in a way that appeals to a broad range of readers and leads into the need. Do not include context for the sake of including context: Rather, provide only what will help readers better understand the need and, especially, its importance. Consider anchoring the context in time, using phrases such as recently, in the past 10 years, or since the early 1990s. You may also want to anchor your context in space (either geographically or within a given research field).\n\nConvey the need for the work as an opposition between actual and desired situations. Start by stating the actual situation (what we have) as a direct continuation of the context. If you feel you must explain recent achievements in much detail — say, in more than one or two paragraphs — consider moving the details to a section titled State of the art (or something similar) after the Introduction, but do provide a brief idea of the actual situation in the Introduction. Next, state the desired situation (what we want). Emphasize the contrast between the actual and desired situations with such words as but, however, or unfortunately.\n\nOne elegant way to express the desired part of the need is to combine it with the task in a single sentence. This sentence expresses first the objective, then the action undertaken to reach this objective, thus creating a strong and elegant connection between need and task. Here are three examples of such a combination:\n\n* To confirm this assumption, we studied the effects of a range of inhibitors of connexin channels . . . on . . .\n\n* To assess whether such multiple-coil sensors perform better than single-signal ones, we tested two of them — the DuoPXK and the GEMM3 — in a field where . . .\n\n* To form a better view of the global distribution and infectiousness of this pathogen, we examined 1645 postmetamorphic and adult amphibians collected from 27 countries between 1984 and 2006 for the presence of . . .\n\n### Task and object\nAn Introduction is usually clearer and more logical when it separates what the authors have done (the task) from what the paper itself attempts or covers (the object of the document). In other words, the task clarifies your contribution as a scientist, whereas the object of the document prepares readers for the structure of the paper, thus allowing focused or selective reading.\n\nFor the task,\n\n* use whoever did the work (normally, you and your colleagues) as the subject of the sentence: we or perhaps the authors;\n* use a verb expressing a research action: measured, calculated, etc.;\n* set that verb in the past tense.\n\nThe three examples below are well-formed tasks.\n\n* To confirm this assumption, we studied the effects of a range of inhibitors of connexin channels, such as the connexin mimetic peptides Gap26 and Gap27 and anti-peptide antibodies, on calcium signaling in cardiac cells and HeLa cells expressing connexins.\n\n* During controlled experiments, we investigated the influence of the HMP boundary conditions on liver flows.\n\n* To tackle this problem, we developed a new software verification technique called oblivious hashing, which calculates the hash values based on the actual execution of the program.\n\nThe list below provides examples of verbs that express research actions:\n\napply \nWe applied Laklöter's principle to . . . \nassess\tWe assessed the effects of larger doses of . . .\ncalculate \nWe calculated the photoluminescence spectrum of . . . \ncompare\tWe compared the effects of . . . to those of . . .\ncompute\tWe computed the velocity predicted by . . .\nderive\tWe derived a new set of rules for . . .\ndesign\tWe designed a series of experiments to . . .\ndetermine\tWe determined the complete nucleotide sequence of . . . \ndevelop\tWe developed a new algorithm to . . .\nevaluate\tWe evaluated the efficacy and biocompatibility of . . .\nexplore\tWe explored the relationship between . . .\nimplement\tWe implemented a genetic algorithm for . . .\ninvestigate\tWe investigated the behavior of . . .\nmeasure\tWe measured the concentration of cadmium in . . .\nmodel\tWe modeled the diffraction behavior of . . .\nFor the object of the document,\n\nuse the document itself as the subject of the sentence: this paper, this letter, etc.;\nuse a verb expressing a communication action: presents, summarizes, etc.;\nset the verb in the present tense.\nThe three examples below are suitable objects of the document for the three tasks shown above, respectively.\n\nThis paper clarifies the role of CxHc on calcium oscillations in neonatal cardiac myocytes and calcium transients induced by ATP in HL-cells originated from cardiac atrium and in HeLa cells expressing connexin 43 or 26.\n\nThis paper presents the flow effects induced by increasing the hepatic-artery pressure and by obstructing the vena cava inferior.\n\nThis paper discusses the theory behind oblivious hashing and shows how this approach can be applied for local software tamper resistance and remote code authentication.\n\nThe list below provides examples of verbs that express communication actions:\n\nclarify \nThis paper clarifies the role of soils in . . .\ndescribe\tThis paper describes the mechanism by which . . .\ndetail\tThis paper details the algorithm used for . . .\ndiscuss\tThis paper discusses the influence of acidity on . . .\nexplain\tThis paper explains how the new encoding scheme . . .\noffer\tThis paper offers four recommendations for . . .\npresent\tThis paper presents the results of . . .\nproposes\tThis paper proposes a set of guidelines for . . .\nprovide\tThis paper provides the complete framework and . . .\nreport\tThis paper reports on our progress so far . . .\nsummarize\tThis paper summarizes our results for 27 patients with . . .\nThe body\nEven the most logical structure is of little use if readers do not see and understand it as they progress through a paper. Thus, as you organize the body of your paper into sections and perhaps subsections, remember to prepare your readers for the structure ahead at all levels. You already do so for the overall structure of the body (the sections) in the object of the document at the end of the Introduction. You can similarly prepare your readers for an upcoming division into subsections by introducing a global paragraph between the heading of a section and the heading of its first subsection. This paragraph can contain any information relating to the section as a whole rather than particular subsections, but it should at least announce the subsections, whether explicitly or implicitly. An explicit preview would be phrased much like the object of the document: \"This section first . . . , then . . . , and finally . . . \"\n\nAlthough papers can be organized into sections in many ways, those reporting experimental work typically include Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion in their body. In any case, the paragraphs in these sections should begin with a topic sentence to prepare readers for their contents, allow selective reading, and — ideally — get a message across.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n\nThis paragraph of materials and methods expresses the main idea first, in a topic sentence, so readers immediately know what it is about.\nMost Materials and Methods sections are boring to read, yet they need not be. To make this section interesting, explain the choices you made in your experimental procedure: What justifies using a given compound, concentration, or dimension? What is special, unexpected, or different in your approach? Mention these things early in your paragraph, ideally in the first sentence. If you use a standard or usual procedure, mention that upfront, too. Do not make readers guess: Make sure the paragraph's first sentence gives them a clear idea of what the entire paragraph is about. If you feel you cannot or need not do more than list items, consider using a table or perhaps a schematic diagram rather than a paragraph of text.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n\nThis paragraph of results and discussion (above) can easily be rewritten (below) to convey the message first, not last.\nThe traditional Results and Discussion sections are best combined because results make little sense to most readers without interpretation.\nWhen reporting and discussing your results, do not force your readers to go through everything you went through in chronological order. Instead, state the message of each paragraph upfront: Convey in the first sentence what you want readers to remember from the paragraph as a whole. Focus on what happened, not on the fact that you observed it. Then develop your message in the remainder of the paragraph, including only that information you think you need to convince your audience.\n\n## The conclusion\n\n\nThis paragraph of results and discussion (above) can easily be rewritten (below) to convey the message first, not last.\nIn the Conclusion section, state the most important outcome of your work. Do not simply summarize the points already made in the body — instead, interpret your findings at a higher level of abstraction. Show whether, or to what extent, you have succeeded in addressing the need stated in the Introduction. At the same time, do not focus on yourself (for example, by restating everything you did). Rather, show what your findings mean to readers. Make the Conclusion interesting and memorable for them.\nAt the end of your Conclusion, consider including perspectives — that is, an idea of what could or should still be done in relation to the issue addressed in the paper. If you include perspectives, clarify whether you are referring to firm plans for yourself and your colleagues (\"In the coming months, we will . . . \") or to an invitation to readers (\"One remaining question is . . . \").\n\nIf your paper includes a well-structured Introduction and an effective abstract, you need not repeat any of the Introduction in the Conclusion. In particular, do not restate what you have done or what the paper does. Instead, focus on what you have found and, especially, on what your findings mean. Do not be afraid to write a short Conclusion section: If you can conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion in the body of the paper, then do so. (In other words, resist the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction just to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion will seem more impressive.)\n\n## The abstract\n\n\nIn just under 200 words, the abstract reproduced here conveys the motivation for and the outcome of the work with some accuracy but without intimidating readers by its length.\nThe readers of a scientific paper read the abstract for two purposes: to decide whether they want to (acquire and) read the full paper, and to prepare themselves for the details presented in that paper. An effective abstract helps readers achieve these two purposes. In particular, because it is typically read before the full paper, the abstract should present what the readers are primarily interested in; that is, what they want to know first of all and most of all.\nTypically, readers are primarily interested in the information presented in a paper's Introduction and Conclusion sections. Primarily, they want to know the motivation for the work presented and the outcome of this work. Then (and only then) the most specialized among them might want to know the details of the work. Thus, an effective abstract focuses on motivation and outcome; in doing so, it parallels the paper's Introduction and Conclusion.\n\nAccordingly, you can think of an abstract as having two distinct parts — motivation and outcome — even if it is typeset as a single paragraph. For the first part, follow the same structure as the Introduction section of the paper: State the context, the need, the task, and the object of the document. For the second part, mention your findings (the what) and, especially, your conclusion (the so what — that is, the interpretation of your findings); if appropriate, end with perspectives, as in the Conclusion section of your paper.\n\nAlthough the structure of the abstract parallels the Introduction and Conclusion sections, it differs from these sections in the audience it addresses. The abstract is read by many different readers, from the most specialized to the least specialized among the target audience. In a sense, it should be the least specialized part of the paper. Any scientist reading it should be able to understand why the work was carried out and why it is important (context and need), what the authors did (task) and what the paper reports about this work (object of the document), what the authors found (findings), what these findings mean (the conclusion), and possibly what the next steps are (perspectives). In contrast, the full paper is typically read by specialists only; its Introduction and Conclusion are more detailed (that is, longer and more specialized) than the abstract.\n\nAn effective abstract stands on its own — it can be understood fully even when made available without the full paper. To this end, avoid referring to figures or the bibliography in the abstract. Also, introduce any acronyms the first time you use them in the abstract (if needed), and do so again in the full paper (see Mechanics: Using abbreviations).\n\n\n\n-----\n\n## Snippet\n\nUse the ctno snippet (type ctno and tab or auto complete to have a predefined structure)\n\n# Title\n\n## Context (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nFirst, provide some context to orient those readers who are less familiar with your topic and to establish the importance of your work.\n## Need (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nSecond, state the need for your work, as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it wants.\n## Task (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nThird, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n## Object (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nFinally, preview the remainder of the paper to mentally prepare readers for its structure, in the object of the document.\n\n\n# Title \ntime\n## Context\nFirst, provide some context to orient you/readers/your grandma who are less familiar with your topic and to establish the importance of this note/paragraph/text/paper/project.\n## Need\nSecond, state the need for your note/paragraph/text/paper/project, as an opposition between what you/others/the scientific community/your grandma currently has and what it wants.\n## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)\nThird, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n- [ ] did this\n- [ ] did that\n- [ ] oh and this also\n## Object (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)\nFinally, preview the remainder of the paper to mentally prepare you/readers for its structure, in the object of the document.","n":0.018}}},{"i":349,"$":{"0":{"v":"Notes","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n# Taking notes vs. making notes\n\n[[nesslabs]]\n\nhttps://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making?ck_subscriber_id=1121227337&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Creating+Habits+%F0%9F%A7%A4%20-%205117179\n\n\nhttps://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2021/01/11/how-to-take-notes/\n\n\n# File over  app\n\nhttps://stephango.com/vault\n\n","n":0.333}}},{"i":350,"$":{"0":{"v":"Smart_notes","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Principles of Smart Notes \n\nhttps://takesmartnotes.com/\n\n## The four underlying principles\n\n1.

La mise en œuvre du protocole de Nagoya en 2014 a établi un cadre juridique protecteur pour favoriser des échanges plus équitables de ressources naturelles et de connaissances associées entre les pays.

read it once and then set it aside, perhaps forever. The review sessions keep you in contact with the ideas, returning you to the material again and again over weeks and months. The ongoing practice changes your relationship to what you read. It gives you a way to bring ideas into your orbit. … When something seems interesting, you can tie a string to it and throw it up in a lazy arc.

Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas \\(AMs\\) with the thalli of bryophytes and the roots of vascular land plants. Not all species have been shown to form AMs, and one, Geosiphon pyriformis, is known not to do so. Instead, it forms an endocytobiotic association with Nostoc cyanobacteria. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are dependent on land plants \\(Nostoc in the case of Geosiphon\\) for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species \\(&gt;80%\\). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.\nAccording to multigene phylogenetic analyses, this taxon is located as a member of the phylum Mucoromycota.

Due to their mechanism of action, these molecules have been classified as plant hormones or phytohormones. So far, strigolactones have been identified to be responsible for three different physiological processes: First, they promote the germination of parasitic organisms that grow in the host plant's roots, such as Striga lutea and other plants of the genus Striga. Second, strigolactones are fundamental for the recognition of the plant by symbiotic fungi, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, because they establish a mutualistic association with these plants, and provide phosphate and other soil nutrients. Third, strigolactones have been identified as branching inhibition hormones in plants; when present, these compounds prevent excess bud growing in stem terminals, stopping the branching mechanism in plants.\nStrigolactones comprise a diverse group, but they all have core common chemical structure, as shown in the image to the right. The structure is based on a tricyclic lactone linked to a hydroxymethyl butenolide; the former is represented in the figure as the A-B-C part, while the latter is the D part of the molecule. It is important to note that most strigolactones present variations in the ABC part, but the D ring is quite constant across the different species, which led researchers to suspect that the biological activity relies on this part of the molecule. Different studies have demonstrated that the activity of the molecules is lost when the C-D section of the molecules is modified.Since strigolactones are involved in the signaling pathway required for germination of parasitic species \\(such as Striga sp.\\), they have been a proposed target to control pests and overgrowth of these parasitic organism. Using a molecule similar to strigolactones could be the key to designing a chemical and biological mechanism to stop the colonization of a plant's root by parasitic plants.\")\n\nInduce hyphal branching in AM fungi.\n\nNepoli experiment :\n\n- graft of WT and dad1 mutant plants.

Karrikins help stimulate seed germination and plant development because they mimic a signaling hormone known as strigolactone. Strigolactones are hormones that help increase growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil, which enhances plant growth and leads to an increase in plant branching.Smoke from wildfires or bushfires has been known for a long time to stimulate the germination of seeds. In 2004, the butenolide karrikinolide \\(KAR1\\) was shown to be responsible for this effect. Later, several closely related compounds were discovered in smoke, and are collectively known as karrikins.\") \n\n\n\n\n# Thursday 02 November 2023\n\n\nthan Nguyen\n\nTrait evolution\n\nnode support value\n\n\nWhite noise model https://timeseriesreasoning.com/contents/white-noise-model/#:~:text=White%20noise%20are%20variations%20in,explained%20by%20any%20regression%20model.&text=The%20observed%20value%20Y_i%20at,N_i%20around%20the%20current%20level.\n\n\nAlison Bender\n\nHoneypots ants\n\n[Myrmecocystus mexicanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecocystus_mexicanus \"Myrmecocystus mexicanus is a species of ant in the genus Myrmecocystus, which is one of the six genera that bear the common name \"honey ant\" or \"honeypot ant\", due to curious behavior where some of the workers will swell with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of nest chambers, acting as living food storage for the colony.

The largely unexplored metabolic diversity, which is rapidly disappearing due to species extinction, is vital for human health and nutrition. In order to uncover and protect this essential natural resource, this initiative has launched a worldwide sampling and digitization project that will encourage cooperation. Our goals include protecting biodiversity, advancing life sciences, and assisting human society by developing sustainable solutions through the creation of an open, accessible, and interoperable Earth Metabolome Knowledge Base and faster global metabolome discovery.\n\n\n## What is the context of this research?\nThe Earth's metabolic diversity, fundamental to biosphere processes, faces an alarming decline as species disappear. The Earth Metabolome Initiative responds to this crisis with a collaborative, global effort to sample and digitize this diversity, creating resources and technologies for accelerated metabolome discovery.\n\n## What is the significance of this project?\n1. Advance Life Sciences: Systematically expand knowledge on global chemodiversity, placing it in the context of biosphere processes and functions. This contributes to the advancement of life sciences and a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships within ecosystems.\n\n2. Benefit Human Society: Develop novel, sustainable solutions in agriculture, medicine, and other fields by connecting metabolites with their roles in living systems. This effort aims to improve human well-being and address societal challenges through the application of metabolome knowledge.\n\n3. Protect Biodiversity: Provide critical information for monitoring, develop novel metrics, and inform predictive tools to prioritize protection and incentivize conservation. The Earth Metabolome Knowledge Base becomes a valuable resource for safeguarding biodiversity and guiding conservation efforts.\n\n## What are the goals of the project?\nIn an effort to accelerate the discovery of metabolites, we are actively working on the development of a machine learning model capable of anticipating metabolite occurrences across various species. Our objective is to use the data that the LOTUS database offers, to forecast metabolite occurrences in species that have not yet undergone detailed examination. This approach would enable us to strategically prioritize species for sampling and digitization, ultimately pinpointing the most promising candidates for uncovering novel metabolites.\n\nTo bring this vision to fruition, we have hired Marco Visani as a Junior Bioinformatician. Marco's role involves crafting an algorithm that integrates historical data from LOTUS and untargeted metabolomics analyses to perform sensitive predictions of the occurences of metabolites in species. Should the project be fully funded, we plan to extend Marco's contract by an additional six months, ensuring the thorough development and refinement of the predictive model.\n\nBy successfully implementing this model, we aim to revolutionize the metabolite discovery process, providing a valuable tool for researchers in various scientific domains. The ability to predict metabolite occurrences not only accelerates the pace of scientific discovery but also optimizes resource allocation for targeted sampling efforts. This initiative aligns with our commitment to advancing open science, and upon completion, the model and its findings will be made available to the scientific community, fostering collaboration and furthering our understanding of the chemistry of life.\n\n\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":441,"$":{"0":{"v":"Expanded_np_chemspace","n":1}}},{"i":442,"$":{"0":{"v":"Abbreviations","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Keywords\nNP - Natural Products  \nDNP - Dictionary of Natural Products (commercially available effors for comiling NP data - https://dnp.chemnetbase.com/)  \nLNPN - [LOTUS database](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net)  \nSSOT - Single Source of Truth  \nOTL - Open Tree of life  \nIDSM - Integrated Database of Small Molecules  \nSMILES - Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (represents chemical structures in a linear string)\nBNICE - Biochemical Network Integated Computational Explorer (enzymatic algorythms)  \nKEGG - Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (database)  \nSMARTS - \"SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification\" \nSMIRKS - \"Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System\" is a hybrid of SMILES and SMARTS.

Scholia\n\nhttps://github.com/fnielsen/scholia\n\nScholia is a python package and webapp for interaction with scholarly information in Wikidata.\n\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/\n\n## Interest of Scholia as a curation page for LOTUS data\n\nCan deal with chemical object \n\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/inchikey/QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N\n\n\n## Contribution \n\nhttps://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n\n\n\n## Egon's footnote \n\nHave you heard about Wikidata already? \"Use Scholia and Wikidata to find scientific literature\" is a new tutorial from my colleague Lauren Dupuis. https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/\n\n## Daniels mail\n\nRegarding the use of Scholia for visualizing structure-taxon relationships, I think this is very possible - we already have aspects for chemicals and for taxa, e.g. as per\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/taxon/Q157892\nor\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/chemical/Q121802 .\n\nWith regards to forks, the most prominent example is probably\nhttps://ordia.toolforge.org/ ,\nwhich visualizes linguistic information based on the lexeme namespace in Wikidata.\n\nAnother thing to think about would be genome browsers like\nhttp://wikigenomes.org/\nor\nhttps://chlambase.org/ .\n\n\nadding additional SPARQL queries to existing Scholia pages is relatively straightforward (the main issue here is performance), so things like adding \"found in taxon\"-based queries to Scholia pages about compounds or taxa and perhaps also pathways could be solved quickly.\n\nWhat might be even more interesting - but would require a bit more work - would be what we call subaspects, i.e. pages that combine two main classes, like https://scholia.toolforge.org/location/Q1748/topic/Q2539 .\n\nWith that in mind, we could think of things like\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/compound/QID1/taxon/QID2\nor\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/taxon/QID3/compound/QID4 .\n\nThe work on such subaspects has been described in\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50813856 for the example of geodata,\nwhich would probably be a good starting point when considering the effort involved.\n\n\n\n##

Note that DOIs are uppercase-normalized in Wikidata.\n\n## Check for the presence of your compound in Wikidata <a name=\"check_compound\"></a>\n\nUsing the compound's InChIKey (i.e. ```QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N``` for trigocherrin A), run a SPARQL query to check if your compound is present in Wikidata or not:\n\n\n```SPARQL\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  VALUES ?classes {\n    wd:Q11173 # chemical compound\n    wd:Q59199015 # group of stereoisomers\n    wd:Q79529 # chemical substance\n    wd:Q17339814 # group of chemical substances\n    wd:Q47154513 # structural class of chemical compounds\n  }\n  ?item wdt:P31 ?classes. # instance of\n  ?item wdt:P235 'QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N'\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }\n}\n```\n[Try this query](https://w.wiki/32zU). You can adapt it by replacing the InChIKey with the one for your compound.\n\nAlternatively you can use the following Scholia link (replace by your compounds InChIKey) [https://scholia.toolforge.org/inchikey/QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N](https://scholia.toolforge.org/inchikey/QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N) \n\nIf your compound is already present on Wikidata, you can directly skip to the [Add the biological source information](#add_bio) section below.\n\n## Add your data manually to Wikidata <a name=\"add_your_data_manually\"></a>\n\nFirst, if you do not have a Wikidata account already, it is advisable that you create one via [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount). While an account is not strictly required for manual edits, having one will be useful if you want to contribute more than once, and it helps in getting your contributions recognized. Note that Wikidata accounts are integrated with accounts across the Wikimedia ecosystem, so if you already have an account on, say, any Wikipedia or on Wikispecies, then you can use the same credentials on Wikidata.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with how Wikidata works, you can start by reading the Wikidata introduction page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction) and have a look at the Wikidata Tours page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours).\n\nNow that you are all set up, you can go to Wikidata's page for creating new items, [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem):\n\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-18-03.png)\n\nAn empty page with a new Wikidata identifier is created \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-18-50.png)\n\n### Add the chemical compound information <a name=\"add_chemical\"></a>\n\nCreate a new statement for ```is an instance of```\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-20-08.png)\n\nand select chemical compound (i.e. [Q11173](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11173)):\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-20-58.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\nSince you created a new item about an instance of a chemical compound, the user interface will automatically propose to you a set of additional statements commonly found on items about chemical compounds.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-22-44.png)\n\nYou can then go on and fill these in.\n\nHere, we start with the InChIKey. \nNote the little flag which will automatically tell you if you have some problems with the recently created statements.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-24-34.png)\n\nHere, Wikidata tells us that if we add an InChiKey, we will need to also add an InChI. Logical, but good to have a reminder !\n\nLet's go ahead and add the InChI string.\n\nLikewise, the addition of an isomeric SMILES string will require us to add a Canonical SMILES.\n\nNote that you might have to copy and paste the SMILES string from PubChem to a plain text editor and then back to Wikidata because of some formatting issues when copy pasting directly from PubChem.\n\n```\nC[C@@H]1C2[C@]([C@H]3[C@H]4[C@]1(C5=CC(=C(Cl)Cl)[C@@H]([C@]5([C@@H]([C@@]6([C@H]4O6)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)OC(O3)(O2)C8=CC=CC=C8)(C(=C)C)O\n\nCC1C2C(C3C4C1(C5=CC(=C(Cl)Cl)C(C5(C(C6(C4O6)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)OC(O2)(O3)C8=CC=CC=C8)(C(=C)C)O\n```\n\n### Add the biological source information <a name=\"add_bio\"></a>\n\nNow let's add the ```found in taxon``` property ([P703](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703)).\n\nJust click on ```Add a new statement``` and type in the first letters of the property you want to add:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-31-56.png)\n\nAgain, type in the first letters of the taxon, and if the organism is present, it will autocomplete. Here is how this looks like for _Trigonostemon cherrieri_:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-33-14.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\n\nIf your target taxon is not yet present on Wikidata and you are sure you have a valid taxon name that is spelled correctly, then you can go to [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem), as described in the [Add your data manually to Wikidata](#add_your_data_manually) section. For items about taxa, the ```instance of``` statement should have a value ```taxon``` (i.e. [Q16521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16521)). As for chemical compounds, the user interface will then suggest to you further statements to add. For taxa, these include taxon name, parent taxon and taxon rank.\n\n\n### Add the reference documenting the structure-organism pair <a name=\"add_ref\"></a>\n\nFinally, since we report documented structure-organisms pairs, we need to add the reference for this newly created ```compound found in taxon``` relationship.\nThis happens on the item about the compound, just below the ```found in taxon``` statement. Click on the ```0 references``` link and then on ```add reference```:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-35-33.png)\n\nHere, we use the ```stated in``` property ([P248](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P248)):\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-36-33.png)\n\nNow, type in the first letters or word of the scientific publication documenting the natural product occurence, autocompletion happens again. Note that multiple publications might have the same title, and that there could be minor differences in punctuation or special characters between the information you and Wikidata have about the same reference. If you are not sure whether your target reference is already in Wikidata, you can use its DOI to check, as outlined in the [Check whether your target reference is already on Wikidata](#check_ref) section.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-38-54.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-39-48.png)\n\n### Check whether your target reference is already on Wikidata <a name=\"check_ref\"></a>\n\nIf you are not sure whether your target reference is already in Wikidata, you can use its DOI to check. For our DOI ```10.1021/ol2030907```, the URL [https://scholia.toolforge.org/doi/___10.1021/ol2030907___](https://scholia.toolforge.org/doi/10.1021/ol2030907) will lead you to a [Scholia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scholia) page about this publication: [https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q83059010](https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q83059010). Scholia visualizes information from Wikidata, so if it has an entry for your target reference, then so does Wikidata, and both of them will use the same identifier (in this case [Q83059010](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059010)). If you prefer to resolve your DOI to Wikidata directly, you can do so by using the uppercase-normalized DOI in the following URL pattern: [https://hub.toolforge.org/P356:**10.1021/OL2030907**](https://hub.toolforge.org/P356:10.1021/OL2030907), which will lead you to the respective Wikidata page, in this case [Q83059010](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059010).\n\nIf you think that no Wikidata entry exists for your target reference, you can use the DOI in the URL pattern [https://sourcemd.toolforge.org/index_old.php?id=**10.1021/ol2030907**&doit=Check+source](https://sourcemd.toolforge.org/index_old.php?id=10.1021/ol2030907&doit=Check+source), which will trigger a check with both Crossref and Wikidata, and if no Wikidata entry can be found, the metadata from Crossref will be fetched and presented to you for creating the respective Wikidata item semi-automatically. Using such semi-automated workflows does require and account that is a minimum number of days old and has made a minimum number of edits on Wikidata.\n\nIf you are interested the annotation of article with topics in Scholia here is a tutorial [https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/](https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/)\n\n\n## Voila !\n\nYou have added your first documented structure-organism relationship to Wikidata and made a valuable contribution to the community.\nYou can add further statements, e.g. ```molecular formula```, or ```SPLASH code``` for linking to spectral data.\n\nThe Wikidata entry [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316) has been started using these instructions.\n\nYou can run a SPARQL query and check that everything went smoothly by modifying the InChiKey line in the following [SPARQL query](https://w.wiki/32zb):\n\n```SPARQL\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?taxonLabel ?artLabel WHERE {\n  VALUES ?classes {\n    wd:Q11173 # chemical compound\n    wd:Q59199015 # group of stereoisomers\n    wd:Q79529 # chemical substance\n    wd:Q17339814 # group of chemical substances\n    wd:Q47154513 # structural class of chemical compounds\n  }\n  ?item wdt:P31 ?classes. # instance of\n  ?item wdt:P235 'QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N' # InChiKey\n  {\n    ?item p:P1582 ?stmt. # natural product of taxon\n    ?stmt ps:P1582 ?taxon. # natural product of taxon\n    OPTIONAL {\n      ?stmt prov:wasDerivedFrom ?ref. \n      ?ref pr:P248 ?art. # stated in\n    }\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?item p:P703 ?stmt. # found in taxon\n    ?stmt ps:P703 ?taxon. # found in taxon\n    OPTIONAL {\n      ?stmt prov:wasDerivedFrom ?ref.\n      ?ref pr:P248 ?art. # stated in\n    }\n  }\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }\n}\n```\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":453,"$":{"0":{"v":"Apps","n":1},"1":{"v":"# Topic tagger\n\nhttps://lubianat.shinyapps.io/topictagger/\n\n# bot tutorial\n\nhttps://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/host/wikidata/bot/\n\n","n":0.447}}},{"i":454,"$":{"0":{"v":"Wget","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n`wget --cookies=on --header=\"Cookie: your_session_cookie\" \"https://filesender.switch.ch/filesender2/download.php?token=2b1ff8d0-80e7-49ac-ac76-8145dacb41f7&files_ids=XXXXXXX\"`\n\nwhile \n\n`wget https://filesender.switch.ch/filesender2/download.php?token=2b1ff8d0-80e7-49ac-ac76-8145dacb41f7&files_ids=XXXXXXX`\n\nwont.\n\nTo be noted if trouble when wgetting a file on the server.","n":0.236}}},{"i":455,"$":{"0":{"v":"Welcome","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\nWelcome the the COMMONS Lab Open Dendron.\n\nIn the COMMONS Lab we intent to follow the Open Notebook Science approach to document our research.\n\nFor this we use the Dendron system as a mean to efficiently capture notes and publish them.\n\n## What is this note\n\nThis note is a succinct tutorial note aiming to get you started in the use of the DBGI Dendron.\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Dendron. \n\n#### What is Dendron ?\n\n> Dendron is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool.

Great experience regarding the advancement of taxon / taxonomic treatments handling.\n\nThis part (current credit attribution and authorship methods could also be discussed and guidelines proposed ? \nI have done some bibliography on this for another project. What looked like the fairest way and simplest is the one proposed by \"The first author takes it all? Solutions for crediting authors more visibly, transparently, and free of bias\" https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12569 and others. Basically alphabetical ordering of the authors + two clear CRediT tables (one by tasks done, one by authors) looks random enough (should be stated explicitely) and explain who has been doing what. The idea is to break the first/last author monopoly which is not the best way to credit authors contrib. A colleague told me that we shouldn't / coulnt do this with PhD, MSc students because they NEED their first author paper. Im happy to hear your thought here. This small app makes it easy to implement such tables. (In a paper like this one it's maybe overkill as their is not much more than writing involved ...) They also suggest everyone should let their email and be corresponding authors.\nYou put me wherever you want, as long as it helps the people in fields where author positions matter. \n\nSee this vbiewpoint as suggestion to ediotrs.\nFor ex. adoption of the CREDIT for authors in NP journals \n\n*3.

A brief description of the review and topic to be covered, including:\n\n    This synopsis aims to provide an overview of the emerging field of open science in natural products research, highlighting its significance, key principles, and potential impact on the field. Natural products have long been a valuable source of compounds with diverse biological activities, contributing to the development of novel drugs, foods and dyes; and form the basis of the traditional medicine used by the vast majority of the world's population. However, the traditionally closed and proprietary nature of natural products research has limited and still hinders the accessibility, reproducibility, and collaboration within the scientific community. The concept of open science promotes transparency, accessibility, and collaboration through the unrestricted sharing of research outputs, data, and methodologies. In this review, we will explore the various aspects of open science in the context of natural products research, including open access publishing, open data, open source software, citizen science initiatives, and collaborative networks. We will discuss the benefits, challenges, and potential solutions associated with adopting an open approach in natural products chemistry, emphasizing the potential for accelerating scientific discovery, fostering innovation, and promoting global collaboration in this vital field. Additionally, we will present novel guidelines for publishing and documenting natural products occurrences, with the aim of proposing standardized practices that could be readily adopted by researchers and publishers in the field. By establishing clear and comprehensive guidelines, we seek to enhance the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) of natural products research, ultimately fostering a more open and collaborative scientific ecosystem.\n\nImplications for the wider scientific community:\n\nThe adoption of open science in natural products research promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. It enhances the reproducibility and reliability of research, accelerates knowledge dissemination, and facilitates the development of NP's applications. It also fosters inclusivity and global collaboration within the scientific community, ultimately advancing the field and benefiting society as a whole. However the transition to open research requires sustained efforts and resources, and these are best mobilized when the benefits of open science are clearly identified by the researchers. Currently, funding agencies are progressively enforcing research outputs, processes and methodologies to be open, making such global transition inevitable in the end. In addition, open science helps people from less privileged places to both learn from and join in on advanced research, breaking down the usual barriers. For individuals outside the institutions of science and industry, it makes complex knowledge easier to access, understand and use, leading to better decisions and creative solutions for problems in their own communities and the wider world.\n\nCommunities the article will appeal to:\n\nnatural products chemists, pharmacologists, medicinal chemists, organic chemists, biochemists, ecologists, cheminformaticians and researchers interested in open science and description of the global chemodiversity. \nIt is also relevant to professionals in academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and those involved in the dissemination of knowledge, including librarians, publishers, and policymakers.\n\nWe therefore aim to address an entire ecosystem, from Knowledge Producers to Knowledge Disseminators in Natural Products Research, as we strongly believe that communities need to act together to improve the health of the whole natural products ecosystem, and that Open Science provides the necessary path and opportunity for strengthening this collaboration in going forward.\n\n*6. Suggested section headings\n\n\t1.  Overview of Natural Products Research from antiquity to nowadays\n\t2. Emergence and current landscape of Open Natural Products Research\n\t3.

Betacyanins, forming the betalain pigment group together with yellow betaxanthins, have gained much attention due to the increasing social awareness of the positive impact of natural products on human health. Betalains are commercially recognized as natural food colorants with preliminarily ascertained, but to be further investigated, health-promoting properties. In addition, they exhibit a remarkable structural diversity based on glycosylated and acylated varieties. The main research directions for natural plant pigments are focused on their structure elucidation, methods of their separation and analysis, biological activities, bioavailability, factors affecting their stability, industrial applications as a plant-based food, natural colorants, drugs, and cosmetics as well as methods for high-yield production and stabilization. This review covers period of the last two decades of betacyanin research. In the first part of the review, we present an updated classification of all known betacyanins and their derivatives identified by chemical means as well as by mass spectrometric and NMR techniques. In the second part, we review the current research reports focused on the chemical properties of the pigments (decarboxylation, oxidation, conjugation, and chlorination reactions as well as the acyl group migration phenomenon) and describe the semi-synthesis of natural and artificial fluorescent betalamic acid conjugates, showing various prospective research directions.\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-p1.tif\nAgnieszka Kumorkiewicz-Jamro\n\nAgnieszka Kumorkiewicz-Jamro received her PhD in 2021 from AGH University of Science and Technology (Cracow, Poland).

Betacyanins, together with yellow-orange betaxanthins, form a group of betalain pigments.1 Simultaneously with anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophylls, betalains are one of the most common plant pigments found in nature.2,3 These compounds share betalamic acid as the main chromogenic structural unit condensed with cyclo-DOPA, forming betanidin or glycosylated cyclo-DOPA in other betacyanins as well as different amino acids or amines in betaxanthins.4,5\nSo far, betacyanins (Table 1) have been assigned to four structural groups comprising betanin-type, gomphrenin-type, amaranthin-type, and Bougainvillea-r-I-type,6,7 the latter was recently renamed as melocactin-type.8 However, for a convenient view on a wide spectrum of pigments, an expanded division with three additional betacyanin groups is proposed based on the sugar linkage: oleracin-type9 (a very early result, not indepedently confirmed), apiocactin-type,10–12 and Bougainvillea-v-type (here, we propose to name it as glabranin-type). In particular, the latter group of the pigments with the structures based on gomphrenin is important in the division system not only because of its less common 6-O-glycosylation pattern but also because of its unique and extremely complex profile of ca. 146 betacyanins tentatively detected in only one plant species, Bougainvillea glabra Choisy,11 including nine definitively identified betacyanins by LC-ESI-MS and NMR.13\n\nTable 1 List of betacyanins (with proposed new trivial namesa) identified by chemical methods; LC-MS and NMR in different plant sources\nNo.\tName\tTrivial name/proposed new namea\tm/z [M + H]+\tChem.\tLC-MS\tNMR\tPlant sources(Chem.)/(LC-MS)/(NMR)\tRef.

Betacyanins assigned to particular types differ in the attachment of the glucosyl moiety to the oxygen atom in the ortho position of cyclo-DOPA as well as the position of the substitution with additional glycosyl or glucuronosyl moieties.6 The esterification of sugar moieties with organic acids such as ferulic, p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic, and malonic acids is very common and leads to the formation of various acylated derivatives. The 15R diastereomers (the isoforms, epimers) of betacyanins are found in plants at much lower concentrations than the 15S forms and are regarded rather as artifacts due to epimerization, which takes place during the preparation of extracted plant samples.14 The first studies on isomerization (as well as decarboxylation) mechanism in betacyanins were performed by Dunkelblum et al.15 In more recent reports, the chromatographic differences in the 15S/15R diastereomers of decarboxylated betacyanins16,17 as well as in the acyl migration products18 were investigated.\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f1.tif\nFig. 1 A new comprehensive classification of betacyanin pigments belonging to the betanin-type (A); amaranthin-type (B); melocactin-type (C); oleracin-type (D); apiocactin-type (E); gomphrenin-type (F); and glabranin-type (G). The structures of betacyanins belonging to the (B–E) types are based on betanin (I), while the structures of glabranins are based on the gomphrenin backbone (II).\t\nBetanin (betanidin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) is the main representative and most common betacyanin pigment found in the plant kingdom (Fig. 1 and 2A). In addition, betanin isolated from Beta vulgaris L. (beetroot, red beet) is the most studied pigment in the context of the antioxidant properties of betacyanins. Structurally, betanin and most of its derivatives are composed of aglycone (betanidin) linked by the β-glucosidic bond with the glucose unit at the C-5 carbon atom.19,20 The chemical structures of additional compounds belonging to betanin-type betacyanins are shown in Fig. 2. Such compounds share a common betanidin backbone in their structures with an additional glucose moiety (betanin) along with (3-methyl-3-hydroxy-methyl)glutaryl-, malonyl-, E-4-coumaroyl-, and E-feruloyl-moieties as well as the half sulphate ester in hylocerenin, phyllocactin, lampranthin I, lampranthin II, and prebetanin, respectively, but can be also partially oxidized (neobetanin) (Fig. 2).\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f2.tif\nFig. 2 Chemical structures of betanin-type betacyanins.\t\nGomphrenin (betanidin 6-O-β-D-glucopyranoside), which is the isomeric pigment to betanin, is found at high concentrations in Basella alba L. fruits as well as in the leaves of its variety Basella alba var. ‘Rubra’ L.21,22 According to our recent recommendation, we propose to rename gomphrenin I as “gomphrenin” in order to simplify the naming of its derivatives, especially generated by gomphrenin decarboxylation and oxidation.16 In contrast to betanins, gomphrenins are characterized by the presence of a glucosyl moiety attached at the carbon C-6 (Fig. 1 and 3A).21,22 Furthermore, the acylation of gomphrenin enables the formation of its derivatives such as E-4-coumaroyl-gomphrenin (former gomphrenin II, globosin), E-feruloyl-gomphrenin (former gomphrenin III, basellin), and E-sinapoyl-gomphrenin (gomphrenin IV, gandolin) (Table 1, Fig. 3B–D).12 Gomphrenin pigments are of interest because their glucosylation position at the carbon C-6 should promote an interaction of the acylated residues with the carboxyl groups by increasing the intramolecular stabilization (by intramolecular stacking) of globosin and basellin23 or other types of multiple acylated sophorosyl residues observed in glabranins. Betacyanins were also detected in red and purple Gomphrena globosa L. inflorescences. The most dominant betacyanins present in red G. globosa cultivars are amaranthin and celosianin but in violet species, gomphrenin and especially the acylated derivatives, globosin and basellin, are present.24,25 In addition, other betacyanins were initially identified, namely, Z-4-coumaroyl-gomphrenin and Z-feruloyl-gomphrenin isomers as well as gandolin.25,26\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f3.tif\nFig. 3 Chemical structures of basic betacyanins (A–D) belonging to gomphrenin-type.\t\nPlant pigments belonging to the amaranthin-type group have a characteristic glucuronosylglucosyl moiety attached to the carbon C-5 in their structure. The most common example of these pigments is amaranthin [betanidin 5-O-β-(2′-O-β-glucuronosyl)glucoside] (Fig. 4A) isolated from plants of the Amaranthaceae family.27,28 The other frequently detected pigments in the plants are betanin and 6′-O-malonyl-amaranthin.29 Furthermore, sinapoyl-amaranthin has been tentatively identified in G. globosa petals.30 Iresinin I [6′-O-(3′′-hydroxy-3′′-methyl)glutaryl-2′-O-glucuronosyl-betanin] and amaranthin are the most abundant pigments detected in Iresine herbstii Hook. ex Lindl leaves (Table 1).27 Acylated amaranthin-based pigments, argentianin and celosianin, were also found in Celosia species31 and the purple leaves of I. herbstii (Fig. 4).25\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f4.tif\nFig. 4 Chemical structures of betacyanins (A–E) belonging to amaranthin-type.\t\nMost of the pigments from the two Bougainvillea groups have sophorosyl moieties linked to carbons C-5 or C-6 of the basic skeleton of betanidin, expanded further by glucosyl, rhamnosyl, apiosyl, or xylosyl moieties.13,26,32–35 A complex mixture of betacyanins that differs in acyl-oligoglycoside units and exists mostly in the 6-O-glycosylated forms of betanidin was initially identified in the purple bracts of B. glabra.13 However, due to the complex mixture of a huge number of betacyanins present in B. glabra,34 its profile has not been completely characterized. The examples of bougainvillein-type betacyanins are bougainvillein-r-I (melocactin-type) and bougainvillein-v (glabranin-type) (Table 1, Fig. 5A and B). Similar betacyanins were recently found within Melocactus species.8 The most abundant pigment, melocactin, previously named ‘bougainvillein-r-I’, was identified as betanidin 5-O-β-sophoroside (Fig. 5A). The presence of feruloylated and sinapoylated melocactins as well as melocactin's malonylated derivative, mammillarinin, was also noted (Fig. 5C).8 In some Mammillaria species, mammillarinin [betanidin 5-O-(6′-O-malonyl)-β-sophoroside] was reported as the dominant pigment.36\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f5.tif\nFig. 5 Chemical structures of betacyanins belonging to both the bougainvillein groups: melocactin-type (bougainvillein-r-I (A) and mammillarinin (C)) and glabranin-type (bougainvillein-v) (B).\t\nTwo red-violet acylated betacyanins, oleracins I and II, have been found in Portulaca oleracea L. Upon hydrolysis in alkaline conditions, oleracins gave ferulic acid and two newly detected pigments that were identified as 5-O-β-cellobiosides of betanidin and isobetanidin (Fig. 1E).9 Five other yellow oleracins were also detected in P. oleracea; however, in contrast to oleracins I and II, they did not possess betalamic acid in their structures.37\n\nBetacyanins belonging to the apiocactin-type group contain the rare branched pentose, apiose, bound to the carbon C-2′ of betanin. Pigments such as 2′-O-β-apiosyl-betanin (apiocactin) and/or its acylated derivatives (Table 1, Fig. 6A–C) have been found in fruits of pokeberry and its corresponding suspension and callus cultures (Phytolacca americana L.), Christmas cactus flowers (Schlumbergera x buckleyi), and Hylocereus species.10,11,38 The chemical structure of the basic apiocactin-type betacyanin present in Hylocereus species was confirmed as 2′-O-β-apiosyl-betanin by Wybraniec et al.11 In addition, in the same study, acylated compounds with sinapoyl and feruloyl residues attached to C-5′′ of the apiose moiety were identified as 5′′-O-E-sinapoyl-apiocactin and 5′′-O-E-feruloyl-apiocactin.11 Similarly, 5′′-O-E-feruloyl-apiocactin was identified earlier in P. americana cultures by Schliemann et al.10 Another betacyanin, 2′-O-β-(5′′-O-E-feruloyl)-apiosyl-phyllocactin, which is the first betacyanin example containing both an aliphatic and an aromatic acyl residue, was tentatively detected in Christmas cactus flower extracts together with other apiocactin derivatives38 and later in Hylocereus species.11\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f6.tif\nFig. 6 Chemical structures of betacyanins (A–D) belonging to apiocactin-type.\t\n2 Characterization of betacyanins\n2.1 Sources of betacyanin pigments\nThere are several known edible sources of betacyanins (Table 1). These include red and yellow beetroots (B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris),1B. alba fruits,39G. globosa flowers,13,30 grainy amaranth (Amaranthus sp.),27 grains of Chenopodium quinoa,40 leaves of A. hortensis var. rubra,41 and fruits/flowers of cacti genera (Opuntia, Hylocereus, Mammillaria, Melocactus, and Myrtillocactus spec.).8,36,42–45 Pokeberry (Phytolacca americana L.) is another source of betacyanins but it has been forbidden as a food colorant due to the presence of toxic saponins and lectins.46\nCompounds tentatively identified as betacyanin-like are also found in some higher fungi such as Amanita muscaria (fly agaric).70,71 The less common edible sources are Ulluco tubers (Ullucus tuberosus)64,72 as well as fruits and berries of pigeonberry (Rivina humilis).73\n\nTable 1 presents a detailed summary of the identified betacyanins in different plant sources along with the methods of their identification. Most of the chemical methods were applied in the early decades of betalain research based on the typical reactions of hydrolysis and derivatization, such as permethylation and partial degradation, resulting in the generation of diagnostic products, which can be identified and can confirm certain parts of the chemical structure of a starting compound. The chemical structures of 31 naturally occurring betacyanins were definitively identified by NMR methods, whereas a huge group of over 187 betacyanins (including pigments from their richest source, B. glabra) were detected by LC-MS techniques and still await the final confirmation. In addition, structures of 18 betacyanin derivatives were also confirmed by NMR and 61 tentatively were identified by LC-MS methods (Fig. 7).\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f7.tif\nFig. 7 The number of naturally-occurring betacyanins and semi-synthesized betacyanins derivatives identified chemically, by NMR techniques and detected by LC-MS methods.\t\n2.2 Biological properties of betacyanins\nNumerous health-promoting activities are attributed to betacyanin pigments, including antioxidative,6,74 chemopreventive,75 and anti-inflammatory76,77 properties. Furthermore, it was noted that betacyanins protect low-density lipoproteins (LDL) against oxidative damage by reacting with the LDL polar groups.78 In addition, betanin present in red beets prevents DNA from damage in lymphocytes and hepatocytes.79 Betanin also shows neuroprotective effects, improves cognitive functions and reduces oxidative stress caused by D-galactose in the brain of mice by increasing the level of antioxidant enzymes and reducing lipid peroxidation.80\nSome betacyanin pigments have been shown to have higher antioxidant activity compared to typical natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid,81 rutin,82 catechin,83 β-carotene,84 and α-tocopherol.6,85 In a test of the antioxidant activity expressed in TROLOX equivalents, betacyanins extracted from red beet exhibited 1.5–2.0 times higher free radical scavenging activity than some anthocyanins such as cyanidine-3-O-glucoside and cyanidine above pH 4.86,87\n\nThe effect of the hydroxyl group position on the antioxidant activity of the betacyanins bearing the conjugated phenol moiety was studied. Three non-natural regioisomeric phenolic betacyanins (common name: o-, m-, p-OH-pBeets) were semi-synthesized by coupling betalamic acid with appropriate aminophenols in water according to a procedure described by Schliemann and co-authors88 and their antioxidant activity was studied.89,90 The results showed that the meta isomer exhibits greater antiradical activity than most of the betalains, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. This result may be explained by the fact that the phenolic moiety is not conjugated with the diazapolymethine system but both groups are prone to further oxidation and can stabilize the radicals by resonance. In addition, the N–H imine bond present in the meta regioisomeric structure is the preferred site for oxidation, whereas 1e− oxidation of the phenolic groups in p- and o-OH-pBeet results in the formation of semi-quinone and leads to lower values of the potential energy (Ep) compared to m-OH-pBeet.89,90\n\nBetacyanins have been shown to actively participate in free radical scavenging and consequently, their consumption may lead to chemoprevention and delay of the development of cancer tissues.75 Purified betanin shows strong inhibition of melanoma cancer cell proliferation91 and excellent growth inhibition of MCF-7 (breast), HCT-116 (colon), AGS (stomach), SF-268 (CNS), and NCI-H460 (lungs) cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 162, 142, 158, 164, and 147 μg mL−1, respectively.92 It has also been found that betanin induces dose- and time-dependent apoptosis of cells in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cell line.93\n\nIn vitro experiments revealed that betalains extracted from B. vulgaris juice show pro-apoptotic effects on activated neutrophils and inhibit the neutrophil oxidative metabolism.94 In addition, pilot clinical trials have shown that short-term treatment with red beet extract improves joint function in people with knee joint discomfort.76,95\n\n2.3 Applications of betacyanin pigments\nIn Fig. 8, betacyanin applications are schematically presented. Natural plant extracts containing betacyanin pigments are increasingly used in food technology as a safe alternative to synthetic food colorants. According to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 73.40 of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA, and under the E-162 code in the European Union, beetroot powder rich in betanin is permitted as a natural red food colorant.3 Food preparations obtained in different industrial conditions can significantly vary in their stability and coloration due to the presence and the composition of betacyanin degradation products. Betalains are stable at pH ranging from 3 to 7 and they are suitable for dyeing low acidic and neutral foods. In addition, they may be stabilized by ascorbic acid. In contrast, due to instability at pH over 3, the application of anthocyanins in the coloration of such foods is not possible. Furthermore, the use of ascorbic acid also facilitates the degradation of anthocyanins. For this reason, the utilization of betalain pigments instead of anthocyanins for coloring food with a high amount of vitamin C or vitamin C-supplemented products seems to be more favorable.96,97 Beetroot extracts are utilized to emphasize the redness of dairy products such as tomato soups, sauces, pastes, desserts, jams, sweets, and jelly beans. They are also used to protect meat from discoloration and to extend its shelf-life.98 However, due to the unpleasant flavor of beetroot extracts due to their geosmin and pyrazine derivatives content, a membrane process during juice concentration is needed to be applied for commercial red beet application.14\nimage file: d1np00018g-f8.tif\nFig. 8 Overview of various betacyanin pigment applications.\t\nDue to health-related benefits, betalains are also regarded as natural dietary supplements.99 The effect of food supplements containing betalain-rich extracts (a betalain-rich supplement of red beetroot and a betacyanin-rich supplement of Opuntia stricta) on different atherosclerotic risk factors were tested among coronary artery disease patients. The results showed that the levels of glucose, total cholesterol, homocysteine, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 48 male patients were decreased. Furthermore, betalain-rich supplements taken at a safe dose of 50 mg betalain/betacyanins for 2 week interventions reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures.100 In the past 20 years, a number of food and nutraceutical preparations have been developed from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) as well. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that quinoa supplementation exerts prominent effects on the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic health of humans.101\n\nNatural plant pigments were also tested in the context of solar cell applications as a cheaper, faster, low energy, and environment-friendly alternative to dyes based on ruthenium complexes.102,103 Betanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin, vulgaxanthin I, extracted from red beetroot extract and betanidin-6-O-(6′,6′′-di-O-E-4-coumaroyl)-β-sophoroside from Bougainvillea were also tested toward the application as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The construction of betalain-based DSSC is possible due to the carboxylic groups in betalains, which serve as anchors after the immersion of TiO2 electrodes in betalain aqueous solutions at pH ≈ 3. The quantum yield of electron injection in betacyanin-based and betaxanthin-based DSSC is about 50% and 70%, respectively. In the case of betaxanthin-based DSSC, the total sunlight conversion efficiency was however smaller because of the blue-shifted absorption band.104 The electron injection from betanin to TiO2 is a two-electron, one-proton process.105,106\n\nEnhanced light-harvesting and the photoconversion efficiency of nanocrystalline TiO2 sensitized with betanin was observed and revealed the self-assembly of betanin on the surface. Due to the fact that an aggregated betanin sensitizer improved the performance in DSSC, the mechanism of improved electron injection and collection in DSSCs with more aggregation as compared to monomeric betanin need to be regarded.107\n\nBetanin is capable of injecting up to two electrons per photon absorbed into the ZnO conduction band in less than 15 ps.108 Betanin was also used for the light-harvesting process in ultra-stable ZnO nanocrystals modified with a carboxylate oligoethylene glycol shell system studied for utilization in H2 production under visible light irradiation.109\n\nThe photophysical properties of betanin in aqueous and alcoholic solutions were determined and formation of betanin electronically excited species was studied. Betanin has a short S1 state lifetime (π, π*) (6.4 ps in water), mainly determined by the efficient S1 → S0 radiationless relaxation, which probably requires a strong geometry change. Other processes, such as photoproduct formation or S1 → T1 intersystem crossing have been reported as virtually absent. In the absence of triplet excited state formation, the fast light-to-heat conversion was observed, supporting the consideration that betanin is a photoprotector in vivo.110,111\n\nDue to the presence of the phenolic moiety within the betanin structure, which may react with 1O2, the colorimetric detection of reactive oxygen species is possible. Efficient singlet oxygen quenching by betanin in deuterated water was reported. The capacity of betanin to quench 1O2 supports the photo-protective role of betanin in vivo.112\n\nIn another study, a red beetroot pigment-based colorimetric sensor for detecting copper ions in drinking water was developed. In addition, an application for quantitative and visual colorimetric analysis was designed for the Android system smartphone. When Cu2+ concentration in drinking water increased, the red beet pigment solution gradually changed from bright purple to orange-red as it formed a complex by chelating Cu2+. The linear range of this detection system ranged from 4 to 20 μM and the limit of detection was 0.84 μM.113\n\nBetanin can also compete with synthetic dyes in terms of the depth and color stability. The possibility of dying of modified acrylic fabrics with betanin was investigated. It was found that the optimal conditions during 45 min dyeing of acrylic fabrics with betanin were 50 °C and pH 5. The modified materials were resistant to color loss under the influence of water and the addition of cobalt(II) sulphate(VI) (CoSO4) ensured light resistance.114\n\nAttempts are being made to develop cheap, green, and easy-to-use betalain-based biosensors. A good example is a need for the early detection of Bacillus species. The highly stable and virulent B. anthracis has been considered as a dangerous bioterrorism agent after the anthrax attack took place in 2001.115 Another threat is pathogenic B. cereus that grows on food.116 In order to detect the Bacillus species early, research on the application of betanin as a ligand in the new europium(III) complex, sensitive to calcium dipicolinate, CaDPA (the major component of the bacterial spore core) was conducted. In the presence of Eu(III) ions, betanin was converted into a water-soluble, non-luminescent orange complex. The addition of CaDPA changes the orange color of the [Eu(betanin)+] aqueous solution to magenta. The limit of detection of CaDPA is about 2.06 × 10−6 mol L−1. In addition, the complex is sensitive to CaDPA but not to other structurally similar aromatic, pyridinic, and acidic ligands.117,118\n\nBeetroot extracts are under consideration as a mild alternative to organometallic reductants, such as NaBH4 and N2H4, and as stabilizing (growth-limiting) agents. Beetroot extract was exploited for the bottom-up synthesis of metal nanoparticles, leading to broad size and shape distributions.119\n\n3 Chemistry of betacyanins and betalamic acid derivatives\n3.1 Overview of betacyanin chemical reactions\nTaking into account the pro-health nature of betacyanin pigments, their diversity, structural characteristics, and light-absorption properties, there is a growing need to supplement and broaden the knowledge on their chemistry. Understanding the reactions that betacyanins undergo may contribute to the determination of their fate and distribution in the human body, increase their stability, the development of betalain-based biosensors, screening assays and tailor-made probes, the preparation of betalain-based potential medicinal substances or cosmetics. In the following part of this contribution, we sum up the current knowledge obtained during the last decade on the chemical properties of betacyanins as well as new perspectives of the semi-synthesis of betalamic acid derivatives with extended chromophoric systems. The list of betacyanin derivatives semi-synthesized from plant sources and betacyanin degradation or chemical conversion products, with their structural identification by LC-MS and NMR methods, is presented in Table 2.\nTable 2 List of betacyanin derivatives semi-synthesized from plant sources and betacyanin degradation or chemical conversion products, with their structural identification by

of betacyanins. Considering the significant impact of organoleptic characteristics on food selection and consumer acceptance, color is one of the most important attributes of foods as it is considered as a quality indicator.120,121 Nowadays, the complex processing of most foodstuffs may cause some unwanted changes in their visual appearance, contributing to the fading effect in their coloration. During the degradation of betacyanins, they may undergo deglucosylation, decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization processes (Fig. 9).\nimage file: d1np00018g-f9.tif\nFig. 9 Possible pathways of betanin transformation by decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, and deglucosylation.129 The m/z values are from the [M + H]+ ions.\t\nThe first heat-degradation structural studies on betanin from B. vulgaris, as well as betacyanins isolated from H. polyrhizus (betanin, phyllocactin, and hylocerenin), were performed by Herbach et al.122–124 and Wybraniec et al.125–127 Betanin was proven to be the most stable pigment, while the stability of phyllocactin and hylocerenin was seemingly enhanced due to the formation of red degradation products, exhibiting improved color retention in comparison to their precursors. Betanin degradation proceeded through hydrolytic cleavage, while hylocerenin dominated in decarboxylation and dehydrogenation. The degradation of phyllocactin involves the decarboxylation of the malonic acid moiety and the formation of betanin by demalonylation along with subsequent betanin degradation. After prolonged heating, dehydrogenation at C2–C3 carbons was also noticed.123–125,127\n\nDecarboxylated and dehydrogenated betanin derivatives occurring at the highest concentrations in a betacyanin-rich red beetroot extract (RBE) were also characterized (Table 2).128 The main pigments in the RBE are betanin and its isoform with 17-decarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin, 15-decarboxy-betanin, and small quantities of 2-decarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin as well as 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin.128 Furthermore, mixtures of mono-, bi-, and tridecarboxylated betanins together with their corresponding neo-derivatives obtained from the RBE were identified as the heating degradation products.129 In addition, new isomeric decarboxylated derivatives, namely, 2,15-bidecarboxy-betanin and 15,17-bidecarboxy-betanin, were detected for the first time. These newly detected derivatives were also formed during heating experiments on red beetroot extract. Furthermore, the presence of 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-betanin was also acknowledged.129 Presumably, the presence of these additional betanin derivatives results from enhanced decarboxylation, which is an integral process during RBE preparation. It was also reported that the higher concentration of acetic acid during the thermal treatment of RBE contributes to a selective formation of 2-decarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin. The latter pigments are present in the RBE at a very low level. However, according to the report, the most decisive factors are the concentrations of the substrate and acetic acid. Higher RBE concentration favors the formation of 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin over 2,15-bidecarboxy-betanin.129\n\nAn effective method for the separation of newly formed derivatives was also proposed. A bunch of decarboxylated and dehydrogenated betacyanins obtained during mild thermal treatment of B. vulgaris juice was subjected to high-performance counter-current chromatographic (HPCCC) preparative fractionations.130 The mixtures composed of betacyanins with different polarity and physicochemical properties were separated in highly polar solvent systems containing a high concentration of ammonium sulfate and ion-pairs, aqueous-organic solvent systems including ion-pair reagents (trifluoroacetic acid, heptafluorobutyric acid). The application of both the solvent systems enabled the separation and purification of 2-decarboxy-betanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin, their corresponding isoforms, and neobetanin from a mixture composed mainly of betacyanins, neobetanin, and their decarboxylated derivatives (Table 2), as well as 17-decarboxy-neobetanin, 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanin, 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-neobetanin, and 2-decarboxy-neobetanin from another mixture consisting of decarboxy- and dehydrobetacyanins. The results also show that the utilization of heptafluorobutyric acid as an ion-pair reagent is more suitable than a polar solvent system with trifluoroacetic acid because it contributes to the formation of more hydrophobic betacyanin ion-pairs.130 The separation of betacyanins from a processed B. vulgaris juice (betanin, isobetanin, neobetanin, and decarboxylated betacyanins) was also demonstrated in a food-grade, gradient solvent system consisting of sodium chloride, butanol, water, as well as different volumes of phosphoric acid and/or ethanol. The quality of isolation was dependent on the ethanol and acid concentrations with the lowest volume gradient, providing the best separation conditions. Betacyanins were eluted in the organic, upper mobile phase, which has a low salt content compared to the aqueous lower phase.131\n\nThe first study on the thermal decomposition of gomphrenin pigments present in the fruit juice of B. alba was carried out and the chromatographic profiles, as well as fragmentation pathways of decarboxylation and dehydrogenation products of gomphrenin (Table 2), were determined by LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS and LC-MS-IT-TOF.16 The short-term treatment of B. alba juice revealed the profiles of mono- and bi-decarboxylated gomphrenins analogous to betacyanins from heated beetroot juice.\n\nProlonged heating of B. alba extract acidified with acetic acid led to the formation of dehydrogenated derivatives as a result of gomphrenin derivative oxidation. The presence of neogomphrenin was detected at a low concentration level in the heated juice, which is opposite to RBE rich in neobetanin. In addition, in contrast to the results of the RBE heating experiments,129 the isomeric 2,15- and 15,17-decarboxylated derivatives were not detected in the heated samples. The above experiments indicated that the chromatographic differences between gomphrenin and betanin derivatives arose from the position of glucosylation in betanidin at carbon atoms C-5 or C-6.16\n\nSawicki and Wiczkowski investigated the impact of boiling and spontaneous fermentation on the betalain profile and content in beetroot. The boiling and fermentation of beetroot decreased the content of the betalains by 51–61% and 61–88%, respectively. Processes occurring during boiling and spontaneous fermentation such as heating, softening, leaching, and acidification together with the matrix effect may be responsible for the changes. In addition, the microbial activity and matrix softening occurring during fermentation caused a release of betalains, which is responsible for the potent antioxidant capacity of the formed beet juice.132\n\nSawicki et al. determined the impact of three technological processes (fermentation, boiling, and microwave-vacuuming treatment) and in vitro digestion on betalain profiles. The content of betalains in the products was reduced by 42–70%. Microwave-vacuuming treatment has contributed to the degradation of betanin at the lowest level and may be regarded as the best treatment method. In addition, the content of betalains released from the beetroot products after in vitro digestion reached the range of 0.001–0.10%, and the number of compounds identified in the digestion phases was decreased.133\n\n3.1.2. Oxidation of betacyanin pigments. Preliminary studies on the enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation of betanidin, betanin, neobetanin, as well as decarboxylated betanins along with the research on intermediate and final reaction products, were carried out.134–136\nBetanidin is the basic structure of all the betacyanins and the only one with the catechol moiety (5,6-dihydroxyl moiety). Studies show that during the oxidation of betanidin, the pigment is most likely converted into three tautomeric quinoid derivatives (Fig. 10). Interconvertions, which occur slowly at pH 4–7 and quickly in a more acidic environment, are likely to result in the formation of dehydrogenated and decarboxylated derivatives. Interconversions between the three tautomeric quinoid forms of oxidized betanidin are based on the proven oxidation pathways of DOPA and dopamine.137,138\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f10.tif\nFig. 10 Scheme of the initial transformations of betanidin during its oxidation and with an indication of the intramolecular conversions between three tautomeric forms based on.134\t\nThe initial oxidation of betanidin should generate the transient radical cation, which rapidly loses a proton and forms a neutral phenoxy radical; it is equivalent to the donation of a hydrogen atom by betanidin or to the loss of a proton with further electron transfer. In the next step, the loss of a second proton and electron results in the formation of a two-electron oxidized form, i.e., one of the three quinoid tautomers. Presumably, not only the betanidin o-quinone with its characteristic absorption spectrum (λmax at 550 and 400 nm) is formed on the first oxidation stage but it is assumed that the two other quinoid derivatives are also possible: dopamine derivative and/or quinone methide. The discussion of the balance between the three tautomeric forms of quinoid remains open.135 As a result, 2,17-bidecarboxy-xanbetanidin (synonym of 2,17-bidecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-betanidin) and 2-decarboxy-xanbetanidin (synonym of 2-decarboxy-2,3-dehydro-betanidin) are postulated as the principal oxidation products formed (Table 2). The recently proposed xan is derived from the hypsochromic shift toward the yellow color of the resulting compounds.\n\nThe further oxidation of 2,17-bidecarboxy-xanbetanidin again involves the formation of one of the two possible quinoid forms as the oxidized intermediates, e.g., the dopachromic derivative of the indolic system. Subsequent rearrangement of the conjugated system of the originated structures into the neo-forms (14,15-dehydrogenated derivatives) is possible which finally leads to 2,17-bidecarboxy-xanneobetanidin (2,17-bidecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanidin), i.e., a compound doubly dehydrogenated at the positions C-2,3 and C-14,15.134–136\n\nIn contrast to betanidin oxidation, no compound that could be regarded as the betanin oxidation intermediate (quinone methide) was detected.139 This could be a consequence of its instability and fast rearrangement combined with decarboxylation. The main compound formed during the first step of betanin oxidation is 2-decarboxy-xanbetanin (Table 2), which exhibits a characteristic protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 505 and an absorption maximum at λmax = 446 nm (Fig. 11). It is not excluded, however, that the generated 2-decarboxy-xanbetanin rearranges to a more stable structure of 2-decarboxy-neobetanin (synonym of 2-decarboxy-14,15-dehydro-betanin). According to the alternative pathway proposed by Wybraniec et al.,135 the formation of 2-decarboxy-neobetanin can result from a rearrangement of the quinone methide generated from 2-decarboxy-betanin. This alternate pathway does not include the presumably more stable product, 2-decarboxy-xanbetanin. Further, the decarboxylation of 2-decarboxy-xanbetanin presumably results in the formation of 2,17-bidecarboxy-xanbetanin. The most hydrophobic product of betanin degradation/oxidation is 2-decarboxy-xanneobetanin, characterized by a protonated molecular ion at m/z 503 and maximum absorption at λmax 422 nm, followed by 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-xanneobetanin.\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f11.tif\nFig. 11 Proposed mechanism of betanin oxidation proceeding through the quinone methide intermediate based on.134,136\t\nIn Fig. 12, the schematic formation of dehydrogenated betanin derivatives is presented along with 2,3-dehydro- and 14,15-dehydro-positions marked on particular pigment structures, together with their abbreviations (xan- and neo-, respectively).52\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f12.tif\nFig. 12 Possible pathways of betanin oxidation with dehydrogenation positions marked on dehydrogenated derivative structures.52,136\t\nIn the case of gomphrenin oxidation by the ABTS cation radical, except for its decarboxylated and dehydrogenated derivatives, the formation of betanidin as well as betanidin derivatives was detected. It is assumed that the rearrangement of dopachromic derivative affects the hydrolysis of the glucosidic bond. This is opposite to betanin, which is not deglucosylated during oxidation in the same reaction conditions. Therefore, it is important to notice that the position of betanidin glucosylation at carbon C-5 or C-6 has a significant influence on the differences in the reactivity of both the 5-O- and 6-O-glucosides.140\n\nIt was reported that metal cations, e.g., copper, aluminum, tin, and iron, accelerate the degradation of betanin even at trace amounts. It is worth noting that the release of metals from food packaging materials may also catalyze the unwanted betacyanin degradation.141 The results of high-resolution mass spectrometry experiments (HRMS) and NMR structural studies on key dehydrogenation products generated during the oxidation of betanin, neobetanin, and decarboxylated derivatives by ABTS cation radical as well as by Cu2+ complexation confirmed that Cu2+ catalyzed oxidation of betanin and 2-decarboxy-betanin leads to the formation of neo-derivatives (14,15-dehydrogenated betanins). It has been proven for the first time that betanin oxidation is possible in the dihydropyridine ring and this can be achieved presumably by omitting the stage of quinone methide formation in the dihydroindole system (Fig. 13). The additional results obtained for Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of 17-decarboxy-betanin and 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin suggest the possibility of formation of xan-derivatives, similar to the results obtained for oxidation by the ABTS cation radical. In this case, the factor determining the oxidation direction is presumably the absence of the carboxyl moiety at carbon C-17, clearly changing the geometry of the complex formed with Cu2+. In addition, the exclusive effect of 2,3-dehydrogenation in 17-decarboxy-betanin is probably supported by the concurrent occurrence of decarboxylation at carbon C-2.52\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f13.tif\nFig. 13 Proposed general oxidation mechanism for betanin and its derivatives, superimposing the effect of Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation with an indication of marked 2,3- and 14,15-dehydrogenation positions based on.52\t\n3.1.3 Conjugation of oxidized betacyanin pigments with sulfhydryl scavengers. A well-developed approach for the direct detection of reactive, short-lived intermediates generated during the oxidation processes is to utilize trapping agents capable of forming stable adducts with the reactive species. The adducts may be detected and characterized using LC-MS/MS and NMR techniques.142 There are many reports on the formation of adducts between nucleophilic thiols and a variety of compounds.143–148 Research on the conjugation of quinones generated during betacyanin oxidation in the presence of thiols seems essential and may broaden the knowledge on betacyanin functions in biological systems.\nThe first studies on the possibility of conjugation of betacyanin reactive quinoids with sulfhydryl scavengers such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), cysteamine (CSH), and DL-ditiothreitol (DTT) were performed recently (Table 2, Fig. 14).140,149 The formation of glutathionylated quinoids, following betanidin and gomphrenin oxidation, confirmed the presence of quinoid forms in the products of pigment oxidation. The chemical structure of glutathionylated betanidin was confirmed by NMR studies. It was also reported that glutathione reacts with quinones at the C-4 carbon of the betanidin ring. On the contrary, the conjugation of the betanin quinoid intermediate (quinone methide) with glutathione was not observed, presumably because of a steric hindrance at the C-7 carbon of betanin, which presumably confirms that the quinoid form generated during betanin oxidation is a quinone methide.140\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f14.tif\nFig. 14 Schematic representation of the conjugation mechanism of betanidin and gomphrenin (A) with sulfhydryl radical scavengers as well as the oxidation of betanin to 2-decarboxy-xanbetanin (B) through the quinone methide intermediate with the following conjugation based on.149\t\nIn order to determine the possibility of attaching thiols to the C-7 carbon of the betanin quinoid, additional research was performed using low molecular weight thiols (Cys, CSH, NAC, DTT). Furthermore, since the conjugation of betacyanins with the thiol groups may generate new molecules with the modified chemical and biological properties, the conjugation reactions with quinones derived from betanidin and gomphrenin were also performed (Fig. 14). The chemical structure of N-acetylcysteinyl-gomphrenin, generated with the highest yield, was determined by the NMR method. The dopachrome derivative from gomphrenin oxidation undergoes conjugation at the C-4 carbon atom. In addition, cysteine conjugate with the oxidized betanin derivative was produced for the first time. The results suggest that the formation of quinone methide during the oxidation of betanin and the production of dopachrome derivative during the oxidation of gomphrenin is highly possible.149\n\nThe results confirm so far that gomphrenin is able to form conjugates with a higher yield than betanin but the ability to form stable conjugates with dehydrogenated betanin derivatives produced during the oxidation of betanin or its intermediate conjugates may also favor this pigment as a valuable food protection component.149 From the perspective of the food industry, this aspect appears to be relevant as the biological activity of gomphrenin and betanin in combination with the possibility of adduct formation between the thiols and betacyanin quinoids may contribute to the increased quality and durability of food products such as meat.146 From another perspective, adduct research can significantly contribute to the development of detection methods for betacyanin quinoids formed in the complex food matrices as well as to research the bioavailability and distribution of betacyanins in humans. The sulfhydryl part of the molecules may modulate their ability to penetrate the biological membranes as well as their absorption and metabolism. Many attempts have been made in the food chemistry to inhibit the formation of oxidative cross-linking proteins, affecting the quality, water content, and red color of meat products. In this respect, CS-conjugates of betacyanins may play a significant role in blocking the thiol groups in food proteins, contributing to improving the food quality.150–152\n\nWhether betacyanins act as effective antioxidants without adverse pro-oxidative effects depends on how quickly their oxidized derivatives gradually degrade through decarboxylation and dehydrogenation as well as through other transformations, including hydrolysis and the final polymerization of betalamic acid and cyclo-DOPA to inactive forms.134,136 So far, no research on the toxicity and stability of quinones produced from betacyanins has been conducted. The literature data are lacking on the pro-oxidative properties of betalains. In addition, there are questions whether betalains are susceptible to undesired metabolic activation and if the blocking of the sites prone to the formation of reactive forms in molecules is required for betalain application as potential therapeutic agents.\n\n3.1.4 Chlorination of betacyanins. The literature reports suggest that betacyanins may be regarded as potent scavengers of inflammatory factors such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In 2007, Allegra et al. reported that betanin and indicaxanthin are effective in the scavenging of hypochlorous acid.77 In addition, both the betalains reduce the myeloperoxidase activity and oxidation, and are therefore regarded as the two key components of the anti-inflammatory processes, leading to the reduction of hypochlorous acid generation.153 In 2016, Wybraniec et al.154 reported that in the reaction between betanin/betanidin/neobetanin and sodium hypochlorite or myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2/Cl− systems, the chlorination of betanin and betanidin took place within the aglycone unit. In addition, the possible reaction with another potent chlorinating agent, Cl2O, which co-exists with HOCl in equilibrium, especially in acidic conditions, was suggested according to a similar mechanism.\nFor neobetanin, no chlorinated products in the reaction mixtures were detected. The fact that the pyridinic ring within the neobetanin structure cannot be chlorinated to form the detectable pigment products indicates that only the unsaturated bond is attacked, preferably at C-18, due to its partial negative charge.154 Monochloro-betanin and monochloro-betanidin were formed with the highest yield at pH 3–5 while at higher Cl− concentrations, the efficiency was dramatically decreased, suggesting that the generated Cl2 is not the chlorinating agent in the presence of sodium hypochlorite. The low activity of Cl2 during betanin and betanidin chlorination compared to HOCl and/or Cl2O was explained by a special position (C-18) of the attack by HOCl and/or Cl2O. In the case of the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system, the highest efficiency of monochloro-betanin/-betanidin generation was observed at pH 5.\n\nIn another study,155 additional chlorination experiments were extended to decarboxylated betacyanins (Table 2). The comparison of the chromatographic profiles of the chlorinated decarboxylated betanins and betanidins generated under the activity of hypochlorous acid revealed two different directions of retention changes in relation to the corresponding precursors. The chlorination of betacyanins decarboxylated at C-17 (17-, 2,17-bi-, and 2,15,17-tri-decarboxy derivatives) resulted in higher retention times in comparison to the corresponding substrates. In contrast, the non-decarboxylated betacyanins as well as their 2- and 15-decarboxy-derivatives exhibited lower chromatographic retention after chlorination.155\n\nThe identification of the chlorinated betacyanins was completed by a further study on the chlorination mechanism and the position of the electrophilic substitution in betacyanins by high-resolution mass spectrometry and further structural analyses by NMR techniques,156 which confirmed that the chlorination position in betanin and decarboxylated betanins occurs within the dihydropyridinic moiety at the C-18 carbon.156\n\nAccording to an electrophilic mechanism based upon the leaving group ability from Cl+ in HOCl (–OH−) and in Cl2O (–OCl−), the reaction paths between betanin and HOCl/Cl2O were proposed (Fig. 15).157 The mechanism was supported by the NMR elucidation results as well as by the inactivity of neobetanin toward chlorination.154 Chlorination version A shows the position of Cl+ attack on C-18 carbon within the betanin structure. The failure in the chlorination of betanin with Cl2, which is an active oxidizing agent, confirmed that Cl+ leaving from HOCl or Cl2O can be the chlorinating factor. Also, the hypothesis that H2OCl+ may be regarded as a chlorinating factor carrying Cl+ is intriguing but has not been confirmed for decades.158\n\n\nimage file: d1np00018g-f15.tif\nFig. 15 Proposed mechanism of betanin chlorination based on two versions of Cl+ ion attack on C-18 carbon. Chlorination version B presents a cyclic intermediate formed during the electrophilic attack of the whole HOCl or Cl2O with the stabilizing effect of the hydrogen bonding.\t\nIn the chlorination version B, a cyclic intermediate159 is formed during the electrophilic attack of the whole HOCl or Cl2O molecules as a result of the polarization of Cl–O bond along with the stabilizing effect of hydrogen bonding. The oxidation of C-18 carbon in betanin did not take place because of its negative charge, making the nucleophilic attack of oxygen159 impossible.\n\nSince fluorescent probes have been promising analytical tools for the rapid and specific detection of HOCl/OCl−, the HCSe and HCS probes were tested in the determination of the betalains' anti-hypochlorite activity. The comparison of the in vitro anti-hypochlorite activities of a betalain-rich red beetroot extract (RBE) with its pure betalainic pigments revealed that the extract had the highest anti-hypochlorite activity, far exceeding the activity of all of the betalainic derivatives and selected reference antioxidants.160 In addition, the pilot clinical studies showed that the short-term treatment with RBE improved the function and comfort of knee joints in individuals with knee distress resulting from increased hypochlorous acid formation.76\n\n3.1.5 The acyl migration phenomenon. The acyl migration phenomenon in betacyanins isolated from Mammillaria and Hylocereus fruits was discovered by Wybraniec et al.11,18,36,56 The driving force behind the research on the acyl migration effect was the fact that 4′-O-malonyl betanin isolated from the cacti fruits of Hylocereus species isomerized to 6′-O-malonyl betanin (phyllocactin) (Fig. 16). It was proved that acyl migration is intramolecular; hence, hydrolysis and re-esterification mechanisms are not relevant in that process.161 For that reason, free carboxylic groups in the acyl moieties present in hylocerenin, phyllocactin, and their derivatives are not involved in the rearrangement. The acyl migration mechanism is based on the interaction of the adjacent group with an ortho acid ester being an intermediate. In many cases, the distance between the acyl migrating group and the free hydroxyl is appropriate for creating of a cyclic intermediate.161–163 The formation of the six-membered cyclic intermediate between the glucosidic O-6′ and O-4′ hydroxyls may be responsible for the intramolecular rearrangement in phyllocactin. The significant factor that provides this phenomenon is the alkaline reaction environment; however, the effect is also observed in acidic conditions.\nimage file: d1np00018g-f16.tif\nFig. 16 The general chemical structure of 6′-O-acylated betacyanin submitted to acyl migration (A) with an established six-membered cyclic intermediate structure formed during acyl migration between the glucosidic O-6′ and O-4′ oxygens in betacyanins (B); a five-membered cyclic ortho ester formed during the acyl migration between O-4′ and O-3′ (C) as well as the final products of acyl migration (D) and (E) (Bd = the rest of betanidin; R = a fragment of an acyl moiety).\t\nA series of new isomers of various 6′-O-acylated betacyanins as well as decarboxylated betacyanins formed by intramolecular pH-dependent acyl migration between adjacent hydroxy groups on polyhydroxy compounds in aqueous solutions was chromatographically characterized.18 The migration rate was markedly accelerated under alkaline conditions at pH 10.5, however, always favoring the 6′-O-position. The phenomenon of acyl migration was less apparent at pH below 7.0. Partial rearrangement may result in the formation of 3′-O- and 4′-O-acylated compounds. In malonylated betacyanins and 17-decarboxy-betacyanins, the 3′-O-acylated forms were presumably the most polar isomers and were eluted first in RP-HPLC, whereas the 4′-O-forms were characterized by retention higher than the 6′-O forms. In contrast, in 2-decarboxy- and 2,17-bidecarboxy-betacyanins, both 3′-O- and 4′-O-acyl-betacyanins were eluted before the 6′-O-acylated forms. The study on the acyl migration effect in 4′-O-malonyl-betanin revealed a strong tendency to reverse acyl migration (4′ → 6′) and also partial rearrangement (4′ → 3′), leading to the monoester regioisomeric distribution in the proportion 87[thin space (1/6-em)]:[thin space (1/6-em)]7[thin space (1/6-em)]:[thin space (1/6-em)]6 [%] in relation to 6′-O-, 4′-O-, and 3′-O-, respectively.\n\nA new malonyl betacyanin, 6′-O-malonyl-amaranthin (celoscristatin), as well as 4′-O-malonyl-amaranthin, formed as a result of the malonyl group migration in celoscristatin, were also identified in Celosia cristata Linn. callus culture.29\n\n3.1.6 NMR elucidation of betacyanin pigments. First NMR structural investigations on betacyanins performed at low pH resulted in the quick degradation of the substances, preventing longer in-depth structural analysis of the betacyanins.53 Nevertheless, key experiments were performed, e.g., confirming the E/Z-stereoisomerism at one of the partial double bonds (C-11,12) in betanidin/isobetanidin.50 As a consequence, only the 13C NMR spectrum of neobetanin was properly registered due to the stability of this dehydrogenated derivative in a highly acidic environment in contrast to other betacyanins. In Fig. 17, an overview of the solvents used for NMR analysis of particular betacyanin pigments is shown. Data acquisition was improved by changing the solvent system for NMR analysis. D2O was found to be the most suitable solvent, which afforded the best long-term stability required for NOESY, HSQC, and HMQC experiments by preventing betacyanin hydrolysis. 1D (1H, 1D TOCSY) and 2D NMR (COSY, TROESY, HSQC, HMQC) measurements for betanin, isobetanin, phyllocactin, and hylocerenin isolated from red-purple pitaya (H. polyrhizus) were performed in D2O.164 For the confirmation of the presence of malonyl moiety exchangeable protons, additional 1H, HSQC, and HMQC experiments for phyllocactin were carried out in a mixture of H2O and D2O (90/10, v/v), slightly acidified with 20 mL of 0.05% aqueous TFA solution (v/v).164\nimage file: d1np00018g-f17.tif\nFig. 17 The summary of the solvents used for NMR spectra registration of particular betacyanins.\t\nThe key products formed after betanin decomposition were identified and their structures were confirmed by NMR analysis. The structural elucidation of 2-, 17-, and 2,17-decarboxy-betacyanins generated during the decarboxylation of betanin, phyllocactin, and hylocerenin isolated from H. polyrhizus fruits was performed by Wybraniec et al.127 A variety of coupled spin systems of all the analyzed compounds were successfully distinguished and assigned by 1H NMR, 1D TOCSY, gCOSY, and NOESY spectra in D2O. Due to gHSQC correlations, the 13C chemical shifts for all the carbons directly bound to the protons were unambiguously assigned, while the gHMBC (the 1H–13C long-range) correlations enabled the establishment of the chemical shifts of the quaternary carbons. In addition, the first 1H NMR spectra of 2-decarboxy-hylocerenin together with all the studied 17-decarboxy- and 2,17-bidecarboxy-betacyanins were received. Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectra of the decarboxylated betacyanins were obtained for the first time.127\n\nThe NMR spectra of amaranthin and iresinin I were recorded in trifluoroacetic acid.61 The structures of the two other acylated betacyanins and lampranthin II from the petals of Lampranthus peersii and L. sociorum as well as celosianin (previously named as celosianin II) from the cell suspension cultures of Chenopodium rubrum were elucidated as 6′-O-E-feruloyl-betanin and 2′′-O-E-feruloyl-β-(1′′,2′)-glucuronosyl-betanin, respectively, by 1H NMR. All 1D (normal and NOE difference) and 2D spectra (COSY) were registered in acidic DMSO-d6 containing traces of DCl.58 A low field shift of the protons H-6′A and H-6′B of the glucosylic moiety in lampranthin II caused by acylation indicated an attachment of the feruloyl moiety at the C-6′ carbon. For celosianin II, the NOE difference spectra indicated that the β-glucuronosyl moiety was bound to C-2′ of the β-glucosyl moiety. The presence of the feruloyl moiety attached at C-2′′ of β-glucuronosyl was evident from the low field shift of H-2′′.58\n\nIn addition to betanin and phyllocactin in H. polyrhizus fruits, another characteristic pigment, hylocerenin [6′-O-(3′′-hydroxy-3′′-methyl-glutaryl)-betanin], was also characterized by 1D and 2D (COSY) NMR techniques in deuterated methanol (CD3OD) containing traces of deuterium chloride (DCl).56 Other unknown pigments, 2′-O-β-apiofuranosyl-betanin and 2′-O-β-apiofuranosyl-phyllocactin, were also elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR techniques in non-acidified D2O.11 The structure of a new malonyl derivative, celoscristatin (6′-O-malonyl-amaranthin), isolated from C. cristata callus culture was confirmed by NMR analysis in D2O.29\n\nIn order to determine the oxidation mechanism of betanin, structures of tentatively identified key dehydrogenation products of betanin, decarboxylated betanin, and neobetanin oxidation by the ABTS cation radical were elucidated by NMR.52 The 1H and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY) measurements were performed in DMSO-d6 for all the studied compounds except for 2-decarboxy-neobetanin, which was analyzed in CD3OD acidified with 0.01% deuterated TFA. The structures of five neo- and xanneo-derivatives, namely, neobetanin, 2-decarboxy-neobetanin, 2-decarboxy-xanneobetanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-xanneobetanin, and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-xanneobetanin, were confirmed.52\n\nThe structures of gomphrenin as well as its acylated derivatives, globosin and basellin, (gomphrenin I, II, and III, respectively) were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy by Heuer et al.24 The 1H and 2D COSY NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD containing traces of DCl. The presence of acyl (4-coumaroyl- and feruloyl-) moieties at the C-6′ carbon in globosin and basellin, respectively, was indicated by a low field shift of the corresponding protons H-6′A and H-6′B. Non-typical 1H chemical shift differences between gomphrenin I and globosin and basellin suggested intramolecular stacking occurring in the latter two compounds.24 In another attempt, gomphrenin was identified by means of 1H, selective NOESY, and TOCSY as well as 2D NMR (COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC) techniques in D2O.69 By NOESY-correlation spectral analysis, it was demonstrated that the glucopyranosyl group is linked to the phenolic group at the C-6 carbon of gomphrenin, which differentiated it from betanin.\n\nThe structures of glutathionylated conjugate of betanidin140 and N-acetylcysteinylated gomphrenin149 were established by NMR analysis, confirming the conjugation position at the C-4 carbon, thus indicating the presence of a dopachromic intermediate during gomphrenin oxidation. All 1H and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, TOCSY, and NOESY) analyses were accomplished in non-acidified D2O. The attachment position of the glutathionyl moiety was primarily indicated by the strong long-range correlation of the H-12a/b′ protons to quaternary C-4 and C-9 carbons as well as a weak correlation to C-8. The lack of the H-4 signal in the 1H spectrum unambiguously confirmed this position.140,149 In the case of N-acetylcysteinylated gomphrenin, the attachment position of the N-acetyl-cysteinyl moiety was initially suggested by a strong, long-range correlation of H-6a/b′′ protons to quaternary carbon C-4. In addition, the lack of the H-4 signal in the 1H spectrum definitely confirmed this position. Furthermore, the CS-conjugation position in gomphrenin was supported by the downfield chemical shift of the H-6a/b′′ proton signal compared to the signal obtained for free N-acetyl-cysteine.149\n\nIn order to prove the position of chlorination in betanin and its decarboxylated derivatives, structural studies were also performed.156 The structure elucidation of 18-chloro-betanin, 18-chloro-17-decarboxy-betanin, and 18-chloro-2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin confirmed that the chlorination position in betanin occurs within the dihydropyridine moiety at carbon C-18. The results of 1H NMR, COSY, and TOCSY analyses obtained for 18-chloro-betanin in non-acidified D2O enabled to distinguish and characterize several diagnostic, conjugated spin systems characteristic for betanin (H-2, H-3ab; H-11, H-12; H-14ab, H-15) in D2O. The dihydroindolic system was indicated by the HSQC correlations of H-2, H-3ab, H-4, and H-7 with their respective carbons. In the dihydropyridine system, the correlations of H-14ab and H-15 with their respective carbons in the HSQC spectra were visible.156\n\nThe structural studies of the newly semi-synthesized pseudo-natural pigments based on betanin hydrolysis were also reported. The structures of various compounds semi-synthesized by coupling betalamic acid with N-methyl anilines, N-aryl anilines, and blue solid named BeetBlue as well as 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin- and 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin-betacyanins (cBeet120 and cBeet151) were accomplished by NMR analysis in D2O.165–167\n\n4 Chemistry of betacyanins and their semi-synthetic derivatives based on betanin hydrolysis\n4.1 Hydrolysis of betanin\nBetanin is susceptible to acid- and base-catalyzed hydrolysis, leading to the formation of colorless cyclo-DOPA-5-O-β-D-glucoside and fairly stable bright yellow betalamic acid (Fig. 18). Recently, new light was shed on betanin hydrolysis mechanism.169 The impact of temperature and pH on the rate of betanin hydrolysis was examined. The mechanism of betanin decomposition was studied in the phosphate solution at pH ranging from 2 to 11 and temperature of 60–85 °C. It was postulated that the fully protonated betanin form is reactive toward the nucleophilic attack of water and the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carboxylic group at C-2 carbon and N-1 nitrogen stabilizes the transition state, leading to the hydrated betanin. The N-1 nitrogen atom was expected to be protonated in the acidic media and to form a leaving group. The protonation of the N-16 nitrogen atom enhances the electrophilicity of C-11, C-13, and C-17 carbons and catalyzes betanin hydrolysis, finally contributing to the opening of the 2,6-dicarboxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine ring of betalamic acid. It was indicated that the hydrogen phosphate ion may act as a general base at pH 8.2, even at a low buffer concentration. The formation of cyclo-DOPA and 2,6-dicarboxy-4-methylpyridine as the products of betanin degradation in an alkaline environment at 130 °C identified by IR spectroscopy was reported in the pioneering work of Wyler and Dreiding on betanin purification by crystallization.47,170 In contrast to that study, 2,6-dicarboxy-4-methylpyridine was not detected.169 However, the presence of cyclo-DOPA, betalamic acid, and decarboxylation/oxidation products was observed.\nimage file: d1np00018g-f18.tif\nFig. 18 Hydrolysis of betanin leading to the formation of betalamic acid and cyclo-DOPA-5-O-β-D-glucoside.\t\nBased on theoretical calculations, the double protonation of the nitrogen atom within the tetrahydropyridine ring cannot be excluded from what was observed for the amino dicarboxylic acids of simpler structures.169\n\nNext to hydrolysis, betacyanins are also sensitive to water-catalyzed isomerization. A study on the hydrolytic stability of betanin Bn, indicaxanthin BtP, and an artificial betalainic coumarin BtC soluble hydrogen bond donating 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) was conducted.171 The hydrolytic stability in water was as follows: BtP > Bn > BtC. Improved hydrolytic stability of the abovementioned betalains in hydroalcoholic solutions was noticed with an increase in the TFE co-solvent. The hydrolysis rate of betalainic coumarin in water was 700-fold greater than in TFE, whereas the use of TFE as a co-solvent reduced the hydrolysis of betanin and indicaxanthin by 20 and 100-times, respectively. The proportion of water and TFE in the co-solvent mixture determined the hydrogen-bond donating capacity, polarity, and ionization power. However, the most important factor of the enhanced hydrolytic stability of the betacyanins is probably due to the low nucleophilicity of TFE. In addition, the fluorescence quantum yields of betaxanthins were also increased with the presence of TFE.171\n\n4.2 One step semi-synthesis of betalains from betalamic acid-derivatized support\nSo far, all the proposed methods of the de novo synthesis of betalains achieve very low efficiency; therefore, the best way to obtain individual betalain derivatives is to isolate them from the biological material and purify. However, this makes the whole process highly time-consuming due to the plant matrix that is rich in various compounds, especially polysaccharides. The process of betalain formation was simplified using a novel betalamic acid-derivatized support (Fig. 19).172 Betalamic acid was produced during betanin hydrolysis from B. vulgaris extract in the presence of cross-linked polystyrene resin at room temperature and nitrogen atmosphere. After the release of betalamic acid and neutralization with acetic acid, the reaction of imine formation between the aldehyde group of betalamic acid and the free primary amine groups present in the matrix surface was performed, resulting in the immobilization of betalamic acid in the resin. The derivatization of the resin with betalamic acid was indicated by the resin color change from pale to intense yellow. After washing and drying at room temperature, the novel solid support was generated and characterized by SEM. The material exhibited the spectroscopic properties of a pseudobetaxanthin. Then, the resin from the betalamic acid-derivatized support was tested toward the production of betalains. As model amines, individual dopamine, tyramine, indoline, and pyrrolidine were added to the support turning the color of the solutions from colorless into yellow in the case of dopamine, tyramine, and pyrrolidine, as well as into purple in the case of indoline. Then, a Schiff's condensation between the amine and betalamic acid anchored in the support provided the dopamine-, tyramine-, pyrrolidine-, and indoline-betaxanthins.172\nimage file: d1np00018g-f19.tif\nFig. 19 Betalamic acid-derivatized support and the surface reaction leading to pigment isolation, based on dopamine-derived betaxanthin: (A) starting material containing primary amine groups; (B) betalamic acid-derivatized support; (C) amine attack to betalamic acid; (D) synthesis and concomitant release of miraxanthin V.172\t\n4.3 Semi-synthetic betalain pigments with extended conjugated systems\n4.3.1 Semi-synthesis of blue pigments from betanin. Naturally-occurring blue pigments are rare, especially among plants. A metal-free photostable blue pigment was designed by extending the π-system of betalains (Table 2).166 The dye was semi-synthesized from betalamic acid, which may be obtained from the hydrolysis of red beetroot juice or by the enzymatic oxidative cleavage of S-DOPA. The 1,11-diazaundecamethinium chromophore of the dye is formed by the irreversible dehydrative C–C coupling of betalamic acid with the carbon nucleophile 2,4-dimethylpyrrole in acidified ethyl acetate (Fig. 20). The reaction lasted less than 30 min and it was performed at room temperature under air condition. The 1,11-diazaundecamethinium chromophore induces a redshift of the absorption and fluorescence spectra in water in relation to standard betanin and indicaxanthin. The product was purified by flash gel permeation chromatography with water used as eluent. This dye exhibits high solubility in polar solvents, e.g., water, and does not produce singlet oxygen upon photoexcitation.166\nimage file: d1np00018g-f20.tif\nFig. 20 Semi-synthesis of a blue dye from betanin derived from beetroot juice.166\t\n4.3.2 Semi-synthesis of a pseudo-natural betalain-nitrone OxiBeet pigment. A prototypical betalain-nitrone pigment (OxiBeet) based on the N-oxide 1,7-diazaheptamethinium scaffold was semi-synthesized for the first time by Capistrano Pinheiro et al. (Table 2).173 Betalamic acid was produced by the hydrolysis of the betalains present in red beetroot juice and coupled with N-phenylhydroxylamine in acidified water, giving rise to OxiBeet pigment (Fig. 21). The resulting product was purified and isolated with 50% yield, which is twice as high as the values reported for other betalains.\nimage file: d1np00018g-f21.tif\nFig. 21 Semi-synthesis of OxiBeet pigment (3) by the acid-catalyzed coupling of betalamic acid (1) and N-phenylhydroxylamine 2 in water.\t\nThis bio-based molecule exhibits low reduction potential and even higher radical scavenging activity than typical antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and gallic acid. Furthermore, it is non-cytotoxic toward human hepatic cell line HepaRG up to 1 mM concentrations. This pseudo-natural product is resistant to hydrolysis under neutral and slightly alkaline conditions and it may also be converted into a persistent N-oxide 1,7-diazaheptamethinium radical cation in an aqueous solutions via autoxidation. These findings open up new perspectives for utilizing betalain pigments and betalain derivatives as therapeutics against various human diseases.\n\n4.3.3 Semi-synthesis of N-methyl phenyl-betaxanthin and N-aryl phenyl-betaxanthin pigments. The semi-synthesis of N-methyl phenyl-betaxanthin (common name: mepBeets) and N-aryl phenyl-betaxanthin (dipBeets) pigments (Table 2) was described by Pioli et al. and the influence of the structure on the betalain derivatives' hydrolytic stability and electronic properties were compared.165 Eight compounds were formed by the derivatization of betalamic acid and N-methyl-anilines as well as N-aryl-anilines in ethyl acetate in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid used as a catalyst (Fig. 22). The stabilization of the positive charge density at the nitrogen atom N-9 by the N-methyl group reduces the rate of hydrolysis by decreasing charge delocalization through the 1,7-diazaheptamethinium system as compared to the non-methylated phenyl-betaxanthin. On the contrary, the N-aryl moiety increases charge delocalization while improving the hydrolytic stability. The electron-withdrawing substituents within the aryl moiety increase the fluorescence quantum yields of semi-synthesized betaxanthins, accelerate hydrolysis, and lower the anodic potential compared to the corresponding unsubstituted betalains. On the other hand, the presence of electron-donating substituents improves their hydrolytic stability. The fluorescence of N-aryl phenyl-betaxanthins is strongly influenced by the polarity and viscosity of the medium which enables the design of the “turn-on” fluorescent (bio)sensors.165\nimage file: d1np00018g-f22.tif\nFig. 22 Semi-synthesis of the mepBeets and the dipBeets via the acid-catalyzed coupling of betalamic acid (1) with N-substituted anilines (2) in ethyl acetate.165\t\n4.3.4 Semi-synthesis of artificial coumarinic betalains. Betalains may be modified to produce water-soluble two-photon fluorophores.167 Coumarinic betalains cBeet120 and cBeet151 (Table 2) were obtained in the reaction between betalamic acid and aminocoumarins in acidified ethyl acetate (Fig. 23). Betalamic acid underwent Schiff condensation (aldimine formation) with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin c120 and 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin c151 in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid used as a catalyst. The coupling of the betalamic acid chromophore to the fluorescent hydrophobic chromophore via the 1,7-diazeheptamethine π-bridge results in a D–π–A molecular arrangement. Coumarinic betalain containing a trifluoromethyl electron-withdrawing substituent within the coumarin moiety is more fluorescent than the one with a methyl group but it has a lower two-photon absorption cross-section, which is attributed to the destabilization of the charge transfer character of the excited state affecting the transition dipole moment.167\nimage file: d1np00018g-f23.tif\nFig. 23 Semi-synthesis of artificial coumarinic betalain pigments with an extended conjugated system.167\t\nIn another study, an artificial coumarinic betalain (BtC) semi-synthesized via the aldimine coupling of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin to betalamic acid was used for the fabrication of the fluorescent probe for the live-cell imaging of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum responsible for malaria disease in humans.168 In order to test the capacity of BtC for labeling living Plasmodium-infected red blood cells, erythrocytes with parasites were incubated with BtC and examined by fluorescence microscopy. BtC was accumulated within the infected cells selectively and fluorescence imaging microscopy has shown that only the parasite was stained. On the contrary, no stain was observed in the infected erythrocytes incubated with an indicaxanthin (control probe) and uninfected cells.168\n\n5 Conclusions\nDuring the last two decades, the research on betalains, more specifically on betacyanins, has experienced significant acceleration due to their health-protective properties as well as applications in the food industry. Before 2000, there were no reports on any pro-health activities of betacyanins; from 2020 onwards, this is the main direction of projects and research on betacyanins. Furthermore, studies on the oxidation mechanism of betacyanins are highly relevant because pigments with different chemical structures seem to have different influence on their oxidation pathways. Considering the fairly simple semi-synthetic methods for additional betacyanin derivatives summarized in this review as well as the first promising results of various studies, the perspectives for further investigations on the bioactivity of betacyanins are inexhaustible. For the time being, the main obstacle that limits the research is the lack of highly efficient and inexpensive methods of betacyanin isolation and purification as well as methods of de novo synthesis. The constantly growing number of potential applications of betalains as natural colorants of food, fabrics, and dietary supplements but also their utilization in sensors, photoprotectors, and solar cells set promising directions of the investigations on these still not fully-explored plant pigments in the near future. In spite of the most recognizable betanin-based betacyanins present in a variety of betalainic plant sources, gomphrenin-like pigments also represent a promising group of potentially more stable and more active compounds at once. There are still many unexplored plants with presumably new interesting betacyanin profiles. The chemical structures of only 31 betalain pigments isolated from the plant sources were definitively identified by the NMR method, which is relatively small in comparison to the other groups of plant pigments. Furthermore, a huge group of over 187 betacyanins (including pigments from their richest source, B. glabra) detected by LC-MS techniques still awaits the final confirmation of their structures. Particular attention should also be paid to the chemical modifications of betacyanins that result in the generation of an increasing number of new derivatives with completely unknown bioactivities. The aspects discussed in this review show that the field of betalain chemistry is a goldmine and ideas for further research are still limitless.\n6 Conflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest.\n7 Acknowledgements\nThis research was financed by Polish National Science Centre for the years 2020–2023 (Project No. UMO-2019/33/N/NZ9/01590) as well as for the years 2018–2021 (Project No. UMO-2017/27/B/NZ9/02831).

Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most. »\n\n« Most workers who are fortunate enough to exert some control over their efforts—such as knowledge workers, small-business entrepreneurs, or freelancers—tend to avoid taking on so much work that they crash and burn, but also tend to avoid working a reasonable amount.

Obsess over quality.\n\n\n### The 70 % rule\n\n\n​\n\nSeventy per cent\nThe 70% rule: If you’re roughly 70% happy with a piece of writing you’ve produced, you should publish it. If you’re 70% satisfied with a product you’ve created, launch it. If you’re 70% sure a decision is the right one, implement it. And if you’re 70% confident you’ve got what it takes to do something that might make a positive difference to the increasingly alarming era we seem to inhabit? Go ahead and do that thing. (Please!)\n\nThere’s more power to this rule than meets the eye. It isn’t solely a way of pushing past perfectionism, though of course that’s valuable in itself. I’m convinced it’s also the way to cultivate a particular kind of sane, action-focused, peaceful-but-energised approach to life that’s becoming more essential by the day. At the risk of offending any sticklers for traditional mathematics, I’m even tempted to argue that 70% is actually better than 100%, at least in this context. Allow me to explain:\n\nIf you’ve any perfectionistic tendencies at all, the 70% rule is unlikely to feel brand new. You’ve probably often been advised to go easy on yourself, to remember that “perfect is the enemy of good”, and so on. Such advice is usually well-meaning, and true so far as it goes: perfectionists should indeed beat themselves up less, and be satisfied with less-than-perfect outcomes. But it still carries the subtle implication that being less than perfect is merely forgivable or excusable – that it would be nice to do better, but since you can’t, there’s no point fretting about it; instead, learn to settle for less. Which makes it tough advice for perfectionists to follow, because it amounts to little more than “don’t be so perfectionistic”. It’s like telling someone who’s a poor swimmer, and wants to become a good swimmer, that what they need to do is to become a better swimmer. I mean, yes. That’s correct! It’s just not especially helpful.\n\nBut the 70% rule – when you begin to grasp it, and to live by it – is something much more potent than that. Following it is a muscular and a muscle-building act. Moving forward at 70% takes more guts, more strength of character, than holding out for 100%, because it entails moving forward amid uncertainty, anxiety, and the disagreeable feeling that comes with putting less-than-perfect work into the world. As so often, a weight-training analogy applies: shooting for 100% is the equivalent of pointlessly straining to lift a dumbbell you can’t possibly lift, then usually giving up, resolving that when you try again tomorrow you’ll magically be strong enough. (But why on earth would you be stronger tomorrow?) Whereas aiming for 70% means lifting the weight you can lift, with a modicum of unpleasant effort. It’s not fun, exactly. But you develop a taste for it. And each time you do it, you’re building the capacity to do more of it in future.\n\nSo every time you release a creative work into the world, or make a commitment, or take an action, despite being no more than 70% satisfied with your output or confident in your abilities, you’re not only bringing something into concrete reality. You’re also expanding your ability to act in the presence of feelings of displeasure, worry and uncertainty, so that you can take more actions, and more ambitious actions, later on.\n\nCrucially, you’ll also be creating a body of evidence to prove to yourself that when you move forward at 70%, the sky stubbornly fails to fall in. People don’t heap scorn on you or punish you. Much of the time, they’re thrilled or grateful you stuck your head above the parapet. The Youtuber Campbell Walker, aka Struthless (one of several people, I learn, who coined the 70% rule before I did) observes that over the long term, this helps you see that your worth isn’t defined by your actions. You don’t need a perfect track record of accomplishments in order to get to count as an adequate human. And this knowledge frees you up to take further, bolder actions, because you’re no longer so fixated on preserving your track record.\n\nThe 70% rule comes with a couple of caveats: You can’t really put a scientific percentage on your feelings, obviously, so perfectionists should beware the risk of obsessing, perfectionistically, over whether they’re at exactly 70% or not. (Note that the rule doesn’t say you should only act when you’re at at least 70% readiness, just that if you’re at 70% readiness, you should act. If you’re happy to act at 60% or 50%, go for it.) And there are big decisions – like, say, whether to get married or divorced, or whether to sign off on the structural safety of the 90-storey skyscraper you’re responsible for building – where a threshold higher than 70% is probably advisable. No need to get perfectionistic about wanting the rule to apply in absolutely every case.\n\nBut such matters aside, I’m willing to bet that making an effort to follow the 70% rule will leave you more productive, more fulfilled, and more able to focus on what matters to you the most. Beyond that, I have a hunch it’ll help you develop precisely the resilience we’re going to need in order to navigate a world that feels ever more beyond our control, and where every day brings destabilising headlines. In this sort of environment, the capacity to act without certainty is essential even just to get through the day, never mind if you’d also like to have an impact on things.\n\nOr to put it in tough-love terms: If you think you might have something to contribute, don’t you have some kind of duty to move forward at 70%, instead of depriving us of your contribution thanks to your finicky and frankly rather self-indulgent insistence on perfection?\n\nThis very newsletter is one small attempt to walk my talk here. I’m still not entirely sure I’ve successfully conveyed why I think the 70% rule is more ambitious than 100%; why it takes guts; why it represents the very opposite of resignation or giving up. But am I about 70% sure I’ve made my point? Yeah, I think so.

He argued that positivism is a false account of knowing.\nHis wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases. He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934. He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils won the Nobel Prize, as well as one of his children. In 1944 Polanyi was elected to the Royal Society.\nThe contributions which Polanyi made to the social sciences include the concept of a polycentric spontaneous order and his rejection of a value neutral conception of liberty. They were developed in the context of his opposition to central planning.\")\n\n\nTheory of personal knowledge\nPolanyi anti-reductionism\n\n\nStandard model of Science : objectivism\n\nMoral inversion: immoral actions are justified by the moral good they serve (e.g. Nazism, Stalinism)\n\n\n\n\nMaybe to connect with Carlo Rovelli's work on the nature of time and the nature of knowledge\n\nIn 1993, in collaboration with Alain Connes, Rovelli proposed a solution to this problem called the thermal time hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, time emerges only in a thermodynamic or statistical context. If this is correct, the flow of time is not fundamental, deriving from the incompleteness of knowledge.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli\n\n\n\nThomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions after listening Polanyi's lectures\n\n\n\nPersonal knowledge is NOT subjectivism\n\n- realism: there is an external reality outside of us \n- submission to shared standards (responsability) e.g apply the scientific method\n- intersubjectivity: \n- universal intent: \n\n\nPolanyi's anti-reductionism\n\nNotion of emergence\n\n\n\nConcept of dual control. \n\n\nPolanyi's is post-critical philosophy.\n\n","n":0.052}}},{"i":477,"$":{"0":{"v":"Rust","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Functions\n\nRust is an expression based language.\n\n- **Statements** are instructions that perform some action but do not return a value.\n\ne.g. `let x = 6;`\n\n- **Expressions** evaluate to a resulting value.\n\ne.g. `x + 1`\n\n## Crates\n\nThey are collection of rust code files. They are binary crates and library crates. Library crates contains code to be used in other programs an not on its own.\n\n## Doc\n\nIf you don't remeber which traits and functions are available in your codebase you can run \n\n```bash\ncargo doc --open\n```\n\n## Shadowing    \n\nThis is convenient when you want to reuse a variable without having to come up with a new name. \n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\nlet x = x + 1;\nlet x = x * 2;\n```\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\nWhat exactly is a variant. How is that different from a trait ?\n\nDefine \n\n- type\n- trait\n- struct\n- enum\n- variant\n- module\n- crate\n- arms: an arm consist of a pattern to be matched agaisnt and the code to be run if the pattern is matched.\n\nFor example\n\n```rust\nlet guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {\n    Ok(num) => num,\n    Err(_) => continue,\n};\n```\nThis is also the case in an if statement. Each blocks of code associated to the if and else are called arms.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let number = 3;\n\n    if number < 5 {\n        println!(\"condition was true\");\n    } else {\n        println!(\"condition was false\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Iif Expressions\n\nIn rust, if should be associated to a boolean. \n\nWhen you have more than one `else if` expression you might want to refactor your code. Rust has a powerful branching construct called `match` for these cases.\n\n## Data types\n\nTwo types of data types in Rust:\n- scalar\n- compound\n\n### Scalar\n\nRepresents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.\n\n#### integers\n\nSigned or unsigned. Signed can be negative or positive. Unsigned can only be positive.\n\nChar\n\nspecified with single quote \n\ne.g `let c = 'z';`\nunlike strings which are specified with double quotes.\n\n### Compound\n\n- tuples\ncannot grow or shrink. fixed lenght. \ne.g. `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`\n\n\nTo access values of the tuple we destructure it\n\n```rust\nlet tup = (500, 6.4, 1);\nlet (x, y, z) = tup;\n\nprintln!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\n```\n\nAnother way to acess elements of the tupple is by using the index\n\n```rust\nlet x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n\nlet five_hundred = x.0;\nlet six_point_four = x.1;\nlet one = x.2;\n```\n\n- arrays\n\nUnlike tupples, every element must be of the same type. They are fixed lenght. \n\n```rust\nlet a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n```\n\nTo acess elements of an array we use the index\n\n```rust\nlet a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet first = a[0];\nlet second = a[1];\n```\n\n## The Slice type\n\n\n\n## Vectors\n\nThese are similar to arrays but can grow or shrink in size. \nThey are stored in the heap rather than the stack which is the case for arrays.\n\nVectors can only store data of the same type.\n\nThe vec! macro is used to create a vector.\n\n```rust\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n```\n\n## Ownership\n\nOwnership is a set of rule governing how Rust manages memory.\n\nThree possibilities for programming languanges:\n\n- their is garbage collection periodically \n- the programmer must explicitily allocate and free memory\n- memory is managed through a system of **ownership** with a set of rules checked by the compiler (rust)\n\n\n### Stck versus heap\n\nThink of stack as a pile of plates. _last in, first out._ You dont remove stuff from in between.\nYopu _push onto the stack_ or _pop off the stack_. All data on the stack must have known, fixed size.\n\nOn the hep, its different and less organized. The memory allocator check for a big enough spacem marks it as beeing in use and returns a _pointer._ This is called _allocating._ Because the pointer is know, fixed sized, you can in turn store it on the stack. \n\nPushing on the stack is much quicker because you just have to add stuff on top. No time wasted in finding free space.\nSimilarly acccessing data on the stack is quicker.\n\n#### Ownership rules\n\n- each values in Rust as an owner.\n- There can be only one owner at a time.\n- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n\n#### Variable scope\n\n\nThe scope is the range within the programm for which an item is valid.\n\n```rust\n    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared\n        let s = \"hello\";   // s is valid from this point forward\n\n        // do stuff with s\n    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid\n```\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes is that rust's `drop` function is automatically runned at the closing opf the curly brackets.\n\n\n## References and borrowing\n\n\nA reference is like a pointer in the sense that it is an adress to be followed to acess the data stored at this adress (data owned by another variable). But unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.\n\n\nThe ampersands represent a reference e.g `&s1`. Here you refer to some value, without taking ownership.\n\n`*`is the _dereferencing_ operator.\n\nBecause we nevere had ownership when using a reference, we do not need to return the values from a function to give back ownership.\nThe creation of a reference is called _borrowing_.\nLike in real life, if a person owns something, you can, sometimes, borrow it. When you are done you give it back, because you dont own it.\n\n\nYou cannot modify stuff you borrow if it is not mutable. However you can make mutable references.\nOne big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you cannot meke another reference to that value.\n\n\nThis allows rust to prevent data race condition.\n\nThis happens in the three sceanrii:\n\n- two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.\n- at least one of the pointers is beeing used to write to the data\n- no mechanism used to synchronize acess to the data.\n\nRules of references.\n\n- at any given time you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.\n- references must always be valid.\n\n## Structs\n\nStructs are similar to Tuples.\nLike tuples pieces of a struct can be different.\nUnlioke tuples, in a Struct youll name each piece of data (these are called fields)\n\nOnce created, structs can be instantiated.\n\n### Tuple structs\n\ne.g. \n```rust \nstruct Color(i32, i32, i32);\n```\n\n### Unit-like structs\n\nEven simpler: they are things such as Unit-like structs.\n\n```rust\nstruct AlwaysEqual;\n\nfn main() {\n    let subject = AlwaysEqual;\n}\n```\n\n## Method syntax\n\nMethods are like functions but unlike functions they are defined within the context of a _struct_ (or an **enum** or a **trait** object). \nThere first parameter is always self, which respresnets the instance of the struct the method is beeing called on.\n\n```rust\nimpl Rectangle {\n    fn area(&self) -> u32 {\n        self.width * self.height\n    }\n    fn width(&self) -> bool {\n        self.width > 0\n    }\n    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {\n       self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese methods are called **associated functions**, they are indeed associated to the struct Rectangle. \nWe can define associated function that DO NOT have self as their first parameters (they are thus not methods.9 because they do not need an instance of the type to work with.\n\nThese associated functions which are not methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the structs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Enums\n\n_Enums_ allow to define a type by enumerating its possible _variants._\nOption is a particularly usefull enum. Encodes that a value can be either something or nothing.\nPattern matching using match makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum.\n\nOne very common enum in rust is Option\n\n```rust\nenum Option<T> {\n    None,\n    Some(T),\n}\n```\n\nYou can even directly \n\n```rust\nlet some_number = Some(5);\nlet absent_number: Option<i32> = None;\n```\n\nOption has a large number of associated methods that can be checked at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html\n\n### match control flow construct\n\nYou can thing of match as a coin sorting machine. The coins slide down a ramp with holes of incresaing size. The first hole fitting size sorts the condition.\nthink of it as conditional expression with if. But the big difference is that it doesnt need to be a boolean.\n\n\nRemeber that the match arms are made by two parts :\n\n- a pattern \n- some code\n\nsepartaed by => \n\n```rust\nenum Coin {\n    Penny,\n    Nickel,\n    Dime,\n    Quarter,\n}\n\nfn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {\n    match coin {\n        Coin::Penny => 1,\n        Coin::Nickel => 5,\n        Coin::Dime => 10,\n        Coin::Quarter => 25,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCombining mathc and enums is extremely frequent pattern in rust programming.\n\nfn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {\n    match x {\n        None => None,\n        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let five = Some(5);\n    let six = plus_one(five);\n    let none = plus_one(None);\n\n    println!(\"six is {:#?} and none is {:#?}\", six, none);\n}\n\nMatches in Rust are _exhaustive_: all the cases must be covered.\n\n\n### catch all patterns and the _ placeholder\n\n\nThis is usefull when you which to aplly and action to some patterns but then apply the same action for the rest of the cases (i.e. a default action)\n\n```rust\nlet config_max = Some(3u8);\nmatch config_max {\n    Some(max) => println!(\"The maximum is configured to be {max}\"),\n    _ => (),\n}\n```\n\nThe last arms catches all other possible cases. We are exhaustive and covered. The empty tuples means no action is taken.\n\n\n\n### if let (when match get's a bit wordy ...)\n\n```rust\nlet config_max = Some(3u8);\nif let Some(max) = config_max {\n    println!(\"The maximum is configured to be {max}\");\n}\n```\n\n### Pattern syntax\n\nPatterns can be used to destructure struct, enums and tuples and use differents parts of these values.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };\n\n    match p {\n        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!(\"On the x axis at {x}\"),\n        Point { x: 0, y } => println!(\"On the y axis at {y}\"),\n        Point { x, y } => {\n            println!(\"On neither axis: ({x}, {y})\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nDestructuring can work on nested object (here enums)\n\n```rust\nenum Color {\n    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),\n    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),\n}\n\nenum Message {\n    Quit,\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n    Write(String),\n    ChangeColor(Color),\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));\n\n    match msg {\n        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {\n            println!(\"Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}\");\n        }\n        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => {\n            println!(\"Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}\")\n        }\n        _ => (),\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you are not going to use a variable yet but want to ignore it. you prefix by _\n\nfn main() {\n    let _x = 5;\n    let y = 10;\n}\n\n### Extra conditionals with Match guards.\n\nA match guards is and additional if condition specified after the pattern in a match arms.Usefull to express complex logic when patterns are not enough.\n\n## Strings\n\n`String` is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions and capabilities.\n\n\n## Traits\n\n\nShared functionalities across data types.\nSimilar to \"interfaces\" in other languages\n\n### The orphan rule\n\nOther crates that depend on the aggregator crate can also bring the Summary trait into scope to implement Summary on their own types. One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type, or both, are local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard library traits like Display on a custom type like Tweet as part of our aggregator crate functionality because the type Tweet is local to our aggregator crate. We can also implement Summary on Vec<T> in our aggregator crate because the trait Summary is local to our aggregator crate.\n**But we can’t implement external traits on external types**. For example, we can’t implement the Display trait on Vec<T> within our aggregator crate because Display and Vec<T> are both defined in the standard library and aren’t local to our aggregator crate. This restriction is part of a property called coherence, and more specifically the orphan rule, so named because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s code can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which implementation to use.\n\n## Modules\n\n## Hash Maps\n\nthese are equivalent to Python's dictionnaries, also called associative arrays in other languages.\n\nHashMap<K, V> \nStored on the heap.\n\nLike Vectors, HashMaps are homegeneous, all of the keys miust have the same \n\nThe HashMaps takes owner ship of the values insert inside.\nYou put them there by hashmap.insert(k, v)\n\n\n#### Overwritting a value\n\nif we \nhashmap.insert(k, v1)\nhashmap.insert(k, v2)\n\nv1 is overwritten\n\n#### Adding value only if absent\n\nhashmap.insert(k, v1)\n\nhashmap.entry(k1).or_insert(v2)\nhashmap.entry(k).or_insert(v2)\n\nv1 is not overwritten because its already present\n\n\n## Iterators\n\nIterators are lazy. They do not do anything until you call a method that consumes the iterator.\nThis is called _consuming an iterator_.\nThe iterator trait is called Iterator. It has a method called next() which returns an Option<T>.\n\n```rust\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet mut iter = v.iter();\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&2));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&3));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\nClosure and map on iterators\n\n```rust\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet mut iter = v.iter();\nlet plus_one = |x| x + 1;\nlet mut iter = iter.map(plus_one);\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(4));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\ncollect() is a method that consumes the iterator and returns a collection.\n\n```rust\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet mut iter = v.iter();\nlet plus_one = |x| x + 1;\nlet mut iter = iter.map(plus_one);\nlet v: Vec<_> = iter.collect();\nassert_eq!(v, vec![2, 3, 4]);\n```\nThe collect() method is a powerful way to transform an iterator into a collection. It can be used to create a vector, a hash map, or any other collection type that implements the FromIterator trait.\n\n\n\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":478,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ressources","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nIt is possible tun Rust interactively see:\n\nhttps://depth-first.com/articles/2020/09/21/interactive-rust-in-a-repl-and-jupyter-notebook-with-evcxr/\n","n":0.378}}},{"i":479,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ressources","n":1}}},{"i":480,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mass Spectrometry","n":0.707}}},{"i":481,"$":{"0":{"v":"Learning","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\nSet of papers shared by Adriano regarding ML approaches and MSMS\n\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00663-z\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.3c00089\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.3c00090\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04824.pdf\n- https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.01.543126\n- https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00932-3\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413\n- https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-vsmpx-v4\n- https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-024-00804-5\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13136\n- https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-w0wvl\n- https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-k06gb\n- https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-024-01112-7\n- https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kss3r\n- https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00816-8\n- https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.02360\n- https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.22.590551\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00857\n- https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6646443621291e5d1d72fa6b/original/universal-fragmentation-model-for-tandem-mass-spectrometry-based-molecular-structural-elucidation.pdf\n- https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-k06gb-v3\n- https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64f76a0279853bbd7829bf27\n- https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-024-00905-1\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c02426\n- https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c03724\n\n### Comparison of Cosine, Modified Cosine, and Neutral Loss Based Spectrum Alignment For Discovery of Structurally Related Molecules\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.2c00153\n\n### Spectral entropy outperforms MS/MS dot product similarity for small-molecule compound identification\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01331-z\n\n### BLINK enables ultrafast tandem mass spectrometry cosine similarity scoring\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40496-9\n\n\n","n":0.118}}},{"i":482,"$":{"0":{"v":"Linkerbio","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nUnleashing Digital Knowledge into the Future\nhttps://linker.bio/\n\n\n### Install Preston \n\nhttps://github.com/bio-guoda/preston\n\n### Following recipee @ https://jhpoelen.nl/bees/\n\n\n\n\nhttps://hash-archive.carlboettiger.info/history/https://www.earthmetabolome.org","n":0.277}}},{"i":483,"$":{"0":{"v":"Datasette","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Resume\n\nDatasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data.

Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved.\n\n\nBut these system builders' discussions are very important, and they are one of the main reasons that the concept of emergence was \"devitalized\", that is, deprived of an immaterial causal agent.\n\n\nEmergence is among other things the concept which relate levels to each other - or to be more precise, the concept which denotes the very passage between them. It does not in itself solve anything, but it poses the problem in a general way, making it visible at the border of every specialized branch of science\n\n\nIn Lloyd Morgan's definition of emergence as \"creation of new properties\" there are three key words: \"properties\", \"new\" and \"creation\". By a more detailed discussion of these key concepts, it is possible to grasp the primary topics in the concept of emergence.\n\n- properties\n\nsecond, and more commonly used definition, tells us that emergence is at stake at the borders between the large sciences: where the explanatory power of one science must give in, another must take over at the level of the hitherto unexplainable - emergent - property. But it is not possible to restrict emergence to these borders. As already Morgan realized, the science usually considered more basic than all others - physics - in itself contains numerous cases of emergence.\n\n\n- novelty\n- creation\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":500,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ontologies","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Software\n\nhttps://bio.tools/\n\nhttps://edamontology.org/page\n\n","n":0.707}}},{"i":501,"$":{"0":{"v":"Nginx","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Title \n2022-11-02 14:42\n## Context\nLooking into nginx to setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server \n\nThis was done on the metabomaps server for the graphDB instance with the help of Jo.\nTrying to reproduce here.\n## Need\nsetup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server\n\n## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)\nThird, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n- [ ] Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c\n\nThey indicate that the conf file is usually under etc/nginx.\nIndeed over there on the metabomaps server.\n\nLets looks at the commonslab server\nNot there.\n\nLets install this\n\nFollowing https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-nginx#2-installing-nginx\n\n\nWe get the following error when starting nginx \n\n(base) allardpm@biolpc045600:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ systemctl status nginx.service\n● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server\n     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n     Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sun 2022-06-19 09:06:20 CEST; 57s ago\n       Docs: man:nginx(8)\n    Process: 3544101 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\n    Process: 3544102 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n\n\nFollowing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51525710/nginx-failed-to-start-a-high-performance-web-server-and-a-reverse-proxy-server\n\n\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n\n\nwe \n sudo service apache2 stop\n\n\n ![](/assets/images/2022-06-19-09-11-18.png)\n\n Amazing !\n\n\n \n- [ ] So this was a first step.\nApparently certbot was used later one.

This is why a clearer name is attributed graphs, or graphs with properties.\n\nThis data model emerged in the early 2000s.\n\n\nOn reification https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(knowledge_representation)\n\nOn open/closed world assumption https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world_assumption \n","n":0.087}}},{"i":514,"$":{"0":{"v":"Nmdc","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nhttps://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema\n\n","n":1}}},{"i":515,"$":{"0":{"v":"Biolink","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nhttps://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/understanding-the-model/\n\n![](/assets/images/2025-05-03-16-04-25.png)","n":1}}},{"i":516,"$":{"0":{"v":"Jupyter","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nTo launch a Jupyter notebook on a remote ssh\n\n1.

But to come back to a project and let it run again can hurt.\nThis should be a small introduction how to handle python environements.  \n\nIt is important for the following steps, to have now activated environments. For example if you using conda (you can see it in the terminal - (base) ), then you should deactivate it. Maybe in the past you had some troubles... It can be a good idea to clean the base in conda.\n\nConda deactivate:           `conda deactivate`  \nConda actiavate (base):     `conda activate`  \nConda clean (base):         `conda clean --all`  \n\nFor checking, which pyhton version is in use:   `which python`  \n\n## Python versions\nAs we all, also Python is developping. Some packages are developped for the newest python and a specific time\nbut not updated for the newest python versions. This can be a problem when you want to use this package, but you just installed the newest version.  \n\nThe solution is to use a virtual environment (for example [__conda__](https://anaconda.org/), [__pipenv__](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), ect.).  \n\nIn this case we will have a look for **pyenv** (the easier way to work with python versions).  \n\n### Pyenv\n\n#### Installation\nTo install [__pyenv__](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) you can use the automatic installer (tested with Ubuntu):  \n`curl https://pyenv.run | bash`  \n\nAfter that you have to add the following lines to your `vim ~/.bashrc` fileend:\n```bash\n#Pyenv loader\nexport PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"\n[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\neval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n\n# Load pyenv-virtualenv automatically\neval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"\n\n```   \n\nTo take this changes into effect you have to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

Remember: the best practice would be using one environment for one project.\n```bash\n# basic installation\npoetry add mkdocs\n\n# for more material <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>\npoetry add mkdocs-material\n```\n\nAlternativaly it can also be done with Pypi:\n```bash\n# basic installation\npip install mkdocs\n\n# for more material <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>\npip install mkdocs-material\n```\n \n\n### Project layout\nIf you run the first time `mkdocs new <project_name>`, it will create new folders for the documentation and a config file (mkdocs.yml). \n\n    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\n    docs/\n        index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.  \n\n### Configuration\nOpen the configuration file (mkdocs.yml) and customize it. This file has some basic functions, which can be very usefull.\nThis file was used in this project <https://commons-research.github.io/dataset-extractor-lotus/>.\n\n```yaml\nsite_name: Dataset Extractor for LOTUS  #websitename (name of project) \nsite_description: \"Python script to extract data from the LOTUS Database\" #description\nsite_url: https://commons-research.github.io/dataset-extractor-lotus/ #website to mkdocs (will be deployd after running 'mkdocs gh-deploy')\nsite_author: <your-name> #your name\nrepo_url: https://github.com/commons-research/dataset-extractor-lotus #Github repository\nrepo_name: GitHub - Dataset Extractor for LOTUS #name of repository\n\nnav: #links to the documentation files in the \"/docs\" folder.\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\nnot_in_nav: #files, which shouldn't be published with mkdocs, but still in the repo.\ntheme: readthedocs #theme\nlanguage: en\n\ntheme: #advanced changes\n  name: material\n  features:\n    - navigation.tabs\n    - navigation.sections\n    - toc.integrate\n    - navigation.top\n    - search.suggest\n    - search.highlight\n    - content.tabs.link\n    - content.code.annotation\n    - content.code.copy\n  language: en\n  palette:\n    - scheme: default\n      toggle:\n        icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline \n        name: Switch to dark mode\n      primary: teal\n      accent: purple \n    - scheme: slate \n      toggle:\n        icon: material/toggle-switch\n        name: Switch to light mode    \n      primary: teal\n      accent: lime\n\n\ncopyright: |\n  &copy; 2024 <a href=\"https://github.com/pamrein\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> YOUR-NAME </a>\n```\n\n### Commands\n* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.\n* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.\n* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.\n* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.\n* `mkdocs gh-deploy` - Deploy the documentation to GitHub pages and push it with the branch gh-pages.\n* `mkdocs gh-deploy --help` - Print help of gh-deploy\n\nThe easiest way to \"deploy\" the documentation is putting the required files in the **/docs** folder and configuring the **mkdocs.yml** file.\nWith the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` the documentation will be deployed and pushed to Github (uses the branch: gh-deploy). This can takes less than a minute. The website name you can find in the terminal output of this command or < username >.github.io/< repository >.\n\n\n### github - workflows \nFor even make it easier for the documentation, it's possible to do an [\"action\"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions?learn=getting_started) on github.\nIt is a `/.github/workflows/*.yml` file, which will be run after a specific event.\nIn this case we will run the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` after a push to the main or master branch.  \n\nCreate the folders and file `/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml` and put the following content in the file (**ci.yml**):\n```yaml\nname: ci-mkdocs\n\n#if pushed from master or main, this action will be triggered\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master \n      - main\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\n#jobs to be executed\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Configure Git Credentials\n        run: |\n          git config user.name github-actions[bot]\n          git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\n      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.x\n      - run: echo \"cache_id=$(date --utc '+%V')\" >> $GITHUB_ENV \n      - uses: actions/cache@v4\n        with:\n          key: mkdocs-material-${{ env.cache_id }}\n          path: .cache\n          restore-keys: |\n            mkdocs-material-\n      - run: pip install mkdocs-material\n      - run: pip install pillow cairosvg\n      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force\n```\nThe main part for this file comes from the following sourece: <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/?h=github#with-github-actions>.  \n\nNow, when you push your documentation with the main branch, it will be automaticaly deployed on github.

Different solutions are available. Mostly we can here about **noSQL** and **SQL** (Structured Query Language) solutions. **RDBMS** (RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System) is the basis for all modern database systems based on SQL. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. This objects can be accessed with querys.\n\nMongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON (no tables). It is more flexible, scalable and faster then the RDBMS approach. \n\nThe website (datanyze))[https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/databases--272] showed, that mainly SQL databases has a big market share. The biggest market share with 24.78% has MySQL. MongoDB is on place 6 with 6.19%. [March 2024]\n\n\n## mongodb\nMongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. The initial release was in February 2009. [Source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)\n\nInstead of using querys (like in SQL), they are using CRUD operations.\n\nThis database is used by the [minesdatabase](https://github.com/tyo-nu/MINE-Database).\n\n\n### Intallation (with Ubuntu)\n[Installation of mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#std-label-install-mdb-community-ubuntu)\n\nAfter the installation, the service has to be started.\n\n```bash\n# start service\nsudo systemctl start mongod\n\n# check status\nsudo systemctl status mongod\n\n# if problems accurese, try this\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n# stop service\nsudo systemctl stop mongod\n```\n\n### mongo shell (CLI)\nTo have a look at the databases use the mongo shell `mongosh`. To use it, the mongod service needs to be running.\nThe MongoDB Shell uses a Node REPL environment. This means that we are able to use JavaScript variable declaration, function declaration, and loops.\n\n```sh\n# start CLI\nmongosh\n\n# show all databases\nshow dbs\n\n# change to database\nuse <db_name>\n\n# show the headers of the database\nshow collections\nshow tables\n\n# find specific coloumns (like Json search)\ndb.<collection_name>.find()\n\n# look at help page\ndb.help\n\n# change store location (default /var/lib/mongodb)\n# it can be changed also in the config file (/etc/mongod.conf)\nmongod --dbpath </path/to/store>\n\n```\n\n### mongo compass (GUI)\nIf the shell is to complicated, it is recommended to use the GUI **mongo compass**. \nIt has the usefull function to show all the entries in one table.\n\nInstallation: <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/master/install/>\n\n### mongo university (learning area)\nMore informations about mongo db can be found here: [Mongo University](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-mongodb)\n\n\n#### mongodb commands\nsearch: \n`db.sales.find({ <field>: { <operator> : <value> } })`\nexample: `db.sales.find({ \"items.price\": { $gt: 50}})`\n\nfield:  \n$elemMatch - find this element in value\n\n\noperator:  \n$eq - equal  \n$gt - greater than\n$gte - greater than or equal to\n$lt - less than\n$lte - less than or equal to\n$ne - not equal\n\n\ndb.sales.find({\n  items: {\n    $elemMatch: { name: \"laptop\", price: { $gt: 800 }, quantity: { $gte: 1 } },\n  },\n})\n\n","n":0.05}}},{"i":540,"$":{"0":{"v":"Copier","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\nhttps://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\nA MAPP copier template is at https://github.com/mapp-metabolomics-unit/mapp-repo-copier-template.git\n\n```bash\ncopier copy https://github.com/mapp-metabolomics-unit/mapp-repo-copier-template.git ./test-copier-repo\n```\n\nTo copy the template of a MAPP repo\n\n```bash\ncopier copy --trust gh:mapp-metabolomics-unit/mapp-repo-copier-template ~/git_repos/mapp-metabolomics-unit/name-of-group\n```","n":0.218}}},{"i":541,"$":{"0":{"v":"Click","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\nhttps://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/testing/","n":1}}},{"i":542,"$":{"0":{"v":"Cfm","n":1},"1":{"v":"installing cfm on server mapp\n\nThursday 14 October 2021\n\nSee instructions here https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/cfm-id-code/src/master/cfm/INSTALL.md\n\n\ntar -zxvf RDKit_2017_09_3.tgz\ncd ../..\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. \\\n    -DRDK_PGSQL_STATIC=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_BUILD_CPP_TESTS=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_BUILD_DESCRIPTORS3D=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_INSTALL_STATIC_LIBS=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_INSTALL_INTREE=OFF\\\n    -DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON\\\n    -DRDK_OPTIMIZE_NATIVE=ON\\\n    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11\\\n    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nmake install\n\n\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH::~/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/lib:~/Programs/lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64\n\n\nbeware no spaces across equal sign\n\n\n\ncmake  ..  \n    -DINCLUDE_TESTS=${BUILD_CFM_TEST}\\\n    -DINCLUDE_TRAIN=${BUILD_CFM_TRAIN}\\\n    -DLPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/lp_solve\\\n    -DLPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/local/lib\\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/rdkit\\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_EXT_DIR=/usr/local/include/rdkit/External\\\n    -DRDKIT_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/local/lib\\\n    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11;\\\n\n\n\ncmake  .. \\\n    -DINCLUDE_TESTS=${BUILD_CFM_TEST}\\\n    -DINCLUDE_TRAIN=${BUILD_CFM_TRAIN}\\\n    -DLPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/lp_solve_5.5\\\n    -DLPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64\\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/Code\\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_EXT_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/External\\\n    -DRDKIT_LIBRARY_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/lib\\\n    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11;\\\n\n\ncmake  .. \\\n    -DLPSOLVE_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/lp_solve_5.5 \\\n    -DLPSOLVE_LIBRARY_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55/bin/ux64 \\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3 \\\n    -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_EXT_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/External \\\n    -DRDKIT_LIBRARY_DIR=/home/allardpm/Programs/rdkit-Release_2017_09_3/lib \\\n    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11;

I am deeply grateful for his unwavering dedication, his genuine interest in this remarkable project, and the invaluable guidance he has provided throughout. I hold great admiration for both his work and the inspiring project he initiated and continues to nurture with such commitment.\n\nThank you to the entire COMMONS LAB team. My warm thanks go to Héloïse Coen, who greatly supported me during the collection of geophytes and extraction processes—your help and our shared moments of collaboration were truly appreciated. Edouard Brülhart, thank you for patiently introducing me to the sampling techniques and the functioning of the laboratory. Colin Volet, for your guidance with the technical aspects of mass spectrometry, your expertise was essential. And finally, Marco Visani, for your remarkable patience and guidance in bioinformatics—thanks to you, I was able to significantly deepen my understanding of coding, an invaluable tool for the work I was entrusted with.\n\n# Abstract \n\nAt a time when the molecular diversity and metabolomic references of living organisms remain largely under-characterized—despite being essential for understanding biodiversity and developing conservation strategies grounded in molecular evidence—existing databases are often fragmented, focused on model organisms or biomedical applications, and poorly suited to large-scale interdisciplinary and ecosystem-level integration. In this context, open initiatives such as LOTUS have emerged, aiming to reference, standardize, and interlink molecule–organism pairs via Wikidata, thereby making chemical knowledge of life more accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Aligned with this vision, the Earth Metabolome Initiative (EMI) sets out to map the entirety of Earth’s metabolome by generating molecular profiles for every known species. My Bachelor’s thesis contributes to this effort through three complementary axis: (1) the collection and metabolomic profiling of geophyte species from the Botanical Garden of Fribourg, as part of the Digital Botanical Gardens pilot initiative; (2) the evaluation of alternative extraction solvents, notably DMSO, to improve compatibility with downstream biological assays; and (3) the modeling of analytical data loss in mass spectrometry using a “fake extract” composed of reference metabolites. \nBy improving some of the key elements of existing workflows and, through the “false extract” project, laying the foundations for anticipating analytical losses in mass spectrometry, this work has helped to initiate a more accurate representation of the chemistry of natural extracts, as well as improving the reuse of extracts for the discovery of new bioactive compounds.\n\n# Introduction \n\nA large number of databases are currently available to the public for biological elements such as proteins (UniProt, https://www.uniprot.org), RNA (Rfam, https://rfam.org/), DNA (NCBI GenBank, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) or genomes (Ensembl, https://www.ensembl.org/). \n\nHowever, some of the databases currently available for metabolomics remain quite limited , focusing mainly on specific types of organism, such as humans (HMDB, https://www.hmdb.ca), for medical purposes and centered on known metabolites, or simply on raw analytical data (MassBank, https://massbank.eu/MassBank/). Another accessible database in metabolomics is the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking ([GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp?redirect=auth)), a collaborative platform for the processing and analysis of mass spectrometry data. GNPS includes both known metabolites and unknown metabolomic profiles. <sup><a href=\"#ref1\" id=\"note1\">1</a></sup>\n\nNatural products (NPs), defined as any chemical entity found in a living organism, are the focus of the open, interoperable, and interdisciplinary database [LOTUS](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/), which is continuously expanding. To meet the goals of an open-source project for the research, storage, and sharing of data on natural products and their source organisms, the data are centralized on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). LOTUS serves as a reference resource, comprising over 750,000 referenced structure-organism pairs, standardized at the chemical (structure), biological (organism), and bibliographic (reference) levels. The project is fully aligned with open science principles and adheres to the FAIR guidelines (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to promote data reuse and integration by the scientific community. <sup><a href=\"#ref2\" id=\"note2\">2</a></sup>\n\nThe [Earth Metabolome Initiative](https://www.earthmetabolome.org/) (EMI) consortium, conceived in 2022 and formally launched in 2024 by Pierre-Marie Allard and Emmanuel Defossez, is a collective open science endeavor aimed at addressing the critical lack of comprehensive metabolomic data for the species of our planet. The initiative set out to build a knowledge graph designed to gather the full spectrum of metabolites across all known living species—approximately 2.3 million—thus encompassing the entirety of life, from microbes to mammals, within an integrated and ecosystem-level perspective. Unlike existing databases, EMI stands out for its clear ambition to cover the full diversity of life across all kingdoms on a global scale. It focuses on the analysis of unknown metabolomic profiles from Earth’s organisms, while aiming to address gaps observed in existing resources such as GNPS, Massbank or HMDB. In particular, EMI sets itself apart by explicitly recovering detailed metadata associated with the profiled organisms—an aspect that remains a notable limitation in GNPS.<sup><a href=\"#ref3\" id=\"note3\">3</a></sup>\n\n## Earth Metabolome Initiative \n\nAs mentioned above, the EMI consortium is an open science initiative with a global scope, whose aim is to draw up metabolomic profiles of all known species on this planet, with 3 main objectives, which are the protection of biodiversity, the benefit to human society and a deeper understanding of the chemical foundations of the biosphere. <sup><a href=\"#ref3\" id=\"note3\">3</a></sup>\n\nBiodiversity is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, primarily driven by the intensification of human activities over the past century. This decline has accelerated dramatically in recent decades. Alarmingly, the current rate of species extinction is estimated to be at least 100 times higher than the natural background rate, underscoring the severity of human impact on the planet's ecosystems. <sup><a href=\"#ref4\" id=\"note4\">4</a></sup> \nIn this context, acquiring comprehensive metabolic data becomes critically important. Such data can provide molecular-level insights into ecosystem functioning and the roles of natural products within them. By deepening our understanding of molecular diversity and its ecological relevance, we can develop informed strategies for conserving biodiversity and sustaining the natural resources upon which human well-being depends.\n\nEstablishing a comprehensive, publicly accessible database of species-specific metabolomic profiles is of paramount importance for advancing research across generations. Such a resource will provide open access to molecular-level data, facilitating a wide spectrum of scientific inquiry—from fundamental biological and biomedical research to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds and innovations in agri-food systems. By enabling a deeper understanding of natural metabolites that underpin ecosystem dynamics, nutritional quality, and agricultural resilience, this database will serve as a critical foundation for interdisciplinary efforts aimed at sustaining both human health and environmental integrity.\n\nThe establishment of a global metabolomic map by the Earth Metabolome Initiative (EMI) will also enable the integration of existing biological datasets with newly generated molecular data. This will facilitate the development of novel insights, such as evolutionary models of the metabolome, and may even allow for the prediction of the chemistry of yet-undiscovered organisms by identifying specific natural product patterns linked to molecular and ecological contexts.\n\nThis project is highly ambitious, and although a significant amount of data has already been collected, the establishment of a global metabolomic database is likely to take decades to fully materialize. For this reason, several pilot projects have been initiated to test data acquisition methodologies and to focus on specific components of the broader initiative, avoiding unnecessary dispersion.\n\nThree of these EMI pilot projects formed the core of my bachelor's thesis and were specifically designed to address key objectives of the Earth Metabolome Initiative.\n\n* The first project falls within the scope of the [Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative](https://www.dbgi.org), a botanical-scale precursor to EMI, in which I participated by collecting samples from the geophyte section of the Fribourg Botanical Garden.\n* The second project aimed to refine our extraction methods by comparing the currently used methanol-based solvent with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), thereby improving the biocompatibility of our extracts for subsequent bioassays.\n* The third project is part of the PhD research of Marco Visani and focuses on modeling molecular data loss in mass spectrometry, with the goal of predicting the chemistry of living organisms based on unknown natural extracts, aligned with [EMI](https://www.earthmetabolome.org/) and [LOTUS](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/) objectives. \n\n## Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative \n\nThe Earth Metabolome Initiative (EMI) is a globally oriented project, and as such, required the development of a pilot version—a scaled-down implementation designed to be applied to nearby, easily accessible, and manipulable living organisms. The Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative was conceived precisely with this objective in mind. \n\nThe initiative aims to digitize the chemical diversity of Swiss botanical gardens by creating extract libraries, analyzing them via mass spectrometry, and organizing the data into accessible, interoperable knowledge systems. It also seeks to develop scalable workflows and provide molecular insights to support biodiversity conservation and open science. \nThese aspects of DGBI are fundamental for ensuring reproducibility of laboratory processes and facilitating automatisation, both of which are critical for the large-scale EMI project, which will handle millions of samples.\n\nSwiss botanical gardens offer several key advantages for this pilot, foremost among them the remarkable diversity of plant species they host, as well as the ease of sampling. \n\nThe [Fribourg Botanical Garden](http://www.unifr.ch/jardin-botanique/fr/), on which I focused my fieldwork, cultivates and conserves approximately 5,000 species, providing a rich and well-documented resource for metabolomic studies. Its location on the University of Fribourg campus is particularly advantageous, offering immediate proximity to laboratories for subsequent analytical work. Moreover, the plants are especially suited for experimental research: they are stationary, easily accessible, available in sufficient quantity for sampling, and can be revisited repeatedly for collections from the same individuals or specific locations when necessary.\n\nWhile the plants are cultivated rather than growing in their natural habitats—an aspect that may slightly influence their metabolic profiles—the primary objective here is not ecological fidelity, but rather the establishment of a solid reference framework. The garden setting provides an ideal platform for testing physical and bioinformatic tools involved in building a curated chemical library, and for evaluating the feasibility of a large-scale digitization project.\n\n# Collection of Geophytes - Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative \n\nThe current data from the Botanical Garden of the University of Fribourg record 1,679 collected plant species (42.7%), 1,250 species extracted beyond the core collection (31.8%), and 691 species for which metabolomic profiles have been generated (17.6%) https://emi-collection.unifr.ch/. While the garden conserves approximately 5,000 individual plants, these represent around 4,000 distinct species, as some are present in multiple specimens.\n\nThe harvest from the geophyte section proved particularly relevant, as this sector had not yet been covered by DGBI. Moreover, collecting additional data from this group contributed meaningfully to the advancement of the project.\n\nGeophytes are perennial plants that exhibit resilience to both severe drought and extreme cold, primarily due to nutrient reserves stored in their underground organs (tubers, bulbs, rhizomes). These reserves enable them to enter a dormant state and persist in the soil until environmental conditions become favorable for growth. <sup><a href=\"#ref5\" id=\"note5\">5</a></sup>\n\n![Map Botanical Garden Fribourg](/bachelor_project_jade/E31D72E1-F056-4554-A0E7-D976B920E21E_1_105_c.jpeg)\n*Figure 1 – Map of Fribourg botanical garden. The location of the geophyte sector is indicated by point number 10*\n\nSeveral plant families were collected, including Amaryllidaceae, Liliaceae, Iridaceae and many others, enabling metabolomic patterns to be drawn up for these families, and for all geophyte-type plants.\n\nWith the help of Héloïse Coen, 185 samples were collected (including leaves and flowers samples) from 150 species. 128 species remain to be collected (46%), meaning that a substantial portion of the target species has already been covered for this part of the project. \n\nBelow are the respective lists of samples collected by myself and Héloïse Coen, as well as the complete list of species in the geophyte section of the Fribourg Botanical Garden. \n* [Geophytes collected by Jade Dandois](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/a4491cbe601b38fbaab3b5437008505f01ea06e1/field_data_trimmed.csv)\n* [Geophytes collected by Heloïse Coen](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/fe70e103e4634caacbb3a798a4f7b7fe4c3beaef/Field_Data%2020250618-12257.csv)\n* [Complete list of geophytes](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/fe70e103e4634caacbb3a798a4f7b7fe4c3beaef/geophytes_extrait.csv)\n\nTo cover this sector, a dedicated protocol for sample collection, extraction, and analysis was required.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Collection \n\nThe [standard DBGI sampling protocol](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/i6scy8dy7a9appqdqvxas6j/) was followed throughout the collection process. Leaf or flower tissues were directly sampled from the target individual. Each specimen was placed in a coffee filter paper, inserted into a pre-labelled Falcon tube, and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C. Samples remained in liquid nitrogen until the end of the field session, after which they were stored at -80 °C pending lyophilization.\n\nEach Falcon tube was pre-labelled with a unique QR code that links the sample to its associated metadata, selected via the QField application (https://qfield.org). For every collected sample, a georeferenced point was recorded on the QField map, accompanied by key identification data including precise location, taxon name, sample ID (matching the QR code), and a set of at least five descriptive photographs: (1) the species identification label, (2) the labelled Falcon tube next to the identification label, (3) a general view of the plant, (4) a close-up of key morphological features, and (5) a photo of the cutting site with the scalpel in place.\n\nThe QR code–linked identification key plays a critical role, providing a unique identifier for each sample and enabling efficient tracking of its metadata across all steps of the workflow—from collection to extraction and analysis. At each successive stage, the same QR code is transferred onto the resulting tube, with newly generated metadata—such as extracted weight, number of extractions, or storage container—systematically appended to the sample’s record.\n\n### Extraction\n\nSamples retrieved from the freezer were placed in a freeze-dryer for 72 hours. After lyophilization, they were transferred into Falcon tubes sealed with non-perforated caps. A mass of 50 milligrams of dried sample was weighed out, allowing for a tolerance of ±5% (±2.5 milligrams), and placed into 2 milliliters round-bottom Eppendorf tubes. Three 4 mm stainless steel beads were added to each tube to facilitate grinding of the extract. The remaining material was returned to its original Falcon tube and stored in a labeled container.\n\nThe weighed samples were ground using a Retsch shaker for 2.5 minutes at 25 Hz. Subsequently, 1.5 milliliters of the DGBI extraction solvent—composed of 80% methanol, 20% distilled water, and 0.1% formic acid—was added to each powdered sample. The tubes were shaken again in the Retsch machine under the same conditions (2.5 minutes at 25 Hz). Following this, the samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13,000 RPM to separate the supernatant from residual plant debris. The supernatant was carefully collected and transferred into labeled vials (2 milliliters) equipped with hermetically sealed caps. These vials were then stored in labeled containers and kept at –80°C until further analysis.\n\n### Aliquoting and analysis in mass spectrometry \n\nFrom the previously prepared vials, 120 microlitres of liquid extract were transferred into new vials equipped with inserts to create aliquots. The vials were carefully sealed using slipped caps. The resulting aliquots were then subjected to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the spectra were analyzed using appropriate tools and software (further details are provided in the subsequent sections of the project).\n\n### Untargeted mass spectrometry \n\nUntargeted mass spectrometry was used, as we did not know the contents of the extract in advance. Therefore, no specific molecules were targeted. The aim was to analyze as many compounds as possible in the extract and recover as much data as possible.\n\nSamples were first analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), which separates components based on their polarity and hydrophobicity, employing a non-polar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. The separated molecules then undergo ionization via electrospray ionization (ESI) in either positive or negative mode, before being detected by an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, offering high mass resolution and accuracy. All molecules are initially detected in MS1, followed by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) where the most intense ions are fragmented in MS2 to generate fragmentation spectra for molecular identification.<sup><a href=\"#ref6\" id=\"note6\">6</a></sup>\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/8C3C38C9-A936-43D3-BBB6-FE08B5C6EFF8_4_5005_c.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 2 : Schematic representation of the sample analysis workflow using mass spectrometry.*\n*The process includes separation via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), ionization and detection using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass analyzer, followed by Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) for MS/MS fragmentation. The diagram was created using MZmine, with parameters configured through the integrated mWizard assistant.* \n\n### Inaturalist \n\nPhotographs associated with each collected species, taken during the field collection process, are uploaded to the iNaturalist platform (https://www.inaturalist.org/). This allows the iNaturalist community—including taxonomic experts—to verify species identities based on detailed images, and provides an opportunity to revise any incorrect or incomplete identifications. In turn, the community also benefits from these data, contributing to the ongoing expansion of the iNaturalist database. [The following map delineates the geographic range corresponding to the geolocated geophyte observations recorded on iNaturalist.](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=46.79293526196035&nelng=7.156343175796218&subview=map&swlat=46.792731427890715&swlng=7.155914022353835&user_id=dbgi&verifiable=any)\n\n## Conclusion \n\nI was therefore able to contribute to the progress of the DGBI pilot by collecting a number of samples from the geophyte sector. Although 46% of this sector still remains to be sampled, metabolomic profiles can already be generated for many of the collected species, with more to follow once sampling is complete. This may eventually enable the identification of metabolomic patterns specific to geophyte plants, and help uncover links or characteristic natural product signatures within certain plant families.\n \n## Perspectives \n\nThe initial objective of the Swiss Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DGBI) was to establish metabolomic profiles of plant species growing in Swiss botanical gardens. To this end, species from the [Botanical Garden of Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/jardin-botanique/fr/) were first collected. Since then, several other botanical gardens in Switzerland have expressed interest in participating in the initiative, including the [Botanical Garden of Neuchâtel](https://www.jbneuchatel.ch)—where a number of species have already been sampled ([more details below](#progress-of-the-neuchâtel-botanical-garden-collection))—as well as the [Conservatory and Botanical Garden of Geneva](https://www.cjbg.ch/) and the [Alpine Botanical Garden Flore-Alpe in Champex-Lac](https://www.flore-alpe.ch/fr/).\n\nAlthough DGBI began in Switzerland, the project is designed to expand internationally. It will remain open as an open science database, not solely as an EMI pilot project. The initiative has already started extending beyond Switzerland, notably with the involvement of the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](https://www.kew.org)—a significant development, given that Kew holds around 68,000 specimens representing approximately 18,000 species.\n\n### Progress of the Neuchâtel botanical garden collection\n\nRegarding the Neuchâtel Botanical Garden, a few figures can be mentioned. Currently 1,300 samples have been collected, of which 880 have been matched with the botanical garden's database. This has made it possible to link them to their IPEN (International Plant Exchange Network) codes.\n\nAccording to the database, the garden contains approximately 2,600 different plant species. At first glance, this may suggest a significant gap ; however, many of these plants are still under cultivation (in greenhouses or outdoors) and are therefore too small to be sampled. Others are not yet labeled, which also complicates the sampling process.\n\nSeveral of the diagrams below illustrate the situation of the Neuchâtel Botanic Garden in terms of diversity and in comparison with global diversity.\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/area_point_layer_directus.png)\n*Figure 3 : Location and organization of plant species in the Neuchâtel Botanical Garden. Each point represents a georeferenced individual plant, colored according to the garden zone to which it belongs.*\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/Barplot_genus_family_2025-06-26.png)\n*Figure 4 : Barplot showing the Neuchâtel garden's coverage of families, genus and species in relation to global diversity*\n\n![alt text](<bachelor_project_jade/Image 26.06.25 à 19.21.jpg>)\n*Figure 5 : Phylogenetic tree of plant families available at the Neuchâtel Botanic Garden*\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/whit_full_plot_2025-06-26.png)\n*Figure 6 : Whittaker diagram illustrating the environmental coverage of plant species sampled at the Neuchâtel Botanical Garden.*\n\n# DMSO Project \n\n## Actual DBGI extraction and issues \n\nAs outlined in the [introduction](#introduction), DGBI is a recent pilot project, one of whose objectives is to evaluate and refine current collection and extraction methodologies, with the aim of improving them where necessary.\n\nOne of the long-term objectives of both EMI and DGBI is to generate libraries of molecules obtained through sample extractions, with the aim of enabling their reuse and distribution to other laboratories for further bioanalysis, including high-throughput biological screening.\n\nHigh-throughput screening (HTS) enables the automated testing of compound libraries to assess their activity against various biological targets. HTS is now extensively used in drug discovery, medical diagnostics, stem cell research, and genetic studies<sup><a href=\"#ref7\" id=\"note7\">7</a></sup>.\n\nThe extraction mixture currently used as a solvent for molecule extraction in the DGBI project consists of 80% methanol, 20% distilled water, and 0.1% formic acid, for a total volume of 200 mL. This composition has proven to be highly effective in extracting metabolites from our samples. However, the solvent currently used in the DGBI project for samples extraction is not compatible with downstream analyses in biological or biochemical laboratories, as methanol can damage cells and formic acid can inhibit enzymatic reactions.\n\n## An alternative to methanol-based extraction \n\nAnother solvent currently widely used in biology laboratories is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a highly stable, soluble, polar, aprotic, and low-toxicity compound, compatible with biological systems<sup><a href=\"#ref8\" id=\"note8\">8</a></sup>. These properties make DMSO an excellent solvent for biological applications.\n\nWithin this context, an additional pilot study was conducted to explore potential enhancements to both the extraction protocol and the solvent used. Specifically, three extraction methods were tested and compared to address the following question: is the extraction method using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as effective as the methanol-based protocol for recovering our target metabolites?\n\nThis study therefore aims to assess whether DMSO could serve as a suitable alternative to the current extraction mixture. If the results prove promising and DMSO performs as effectively as the methanol–water–formic acid mixture in extracting target molecules, it could be adopted in future protocols—thus enabling the reuse of extracted samples for pharmacological research purposes.\n\n## Material and methods \n\nThe [standard DBGI extraction protocol](#extraction) described above was followed for this pilot study, with the exception of the extraction solvent, which was modified for comparative purposes.\n\nIn this experiment, six well-documented plant samples (*Valeriana officinalis*, *Echinacea purpurea*, *Cannabis sativa*, *Erythroxylum coca*, *Salvia officinalis*, and *Nicotiana tabacum*) were tested using three extraction methods: the standard DBGI protocol with its usual solvent (80% methanol, 20% distilled water, 0.1% formic acid), a pure DMSO extraction (99.8%), and a DMSO extraction followed by sonication (5 minutes of high-frequency sound wave pulses generating bubbles that promote cell lysis).<sup><a href=\"#ref9\" id=\"note9\">9</a></sup>\n\nFor each method, one Eppendorf tube was prepared per sample. Two blanks were also included in the experiment, using the methanol-water-formic acid mixture and pure DMSO, respectively.\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/703ef64f-355e-430f-a742-e511a483a0db.jpg)\n*Figure 7 : Eppendorf tubes after centrifugation with supernatant ready for recovery. The 6 samples per extraction method (A, B, C) are shown. A: Methanol-water-formic acid extraction method; B: Simple DMSO extraction; C: DMSO extraction with sonication.* \n\nThe resulting 20 samples were then transferred to vials for mass spectrometry and subsequent analysis.\n\n### Evaluation of extractions\n\nThe files generated from mass spectrometry analysis of the samples were processed using MZmine for the interpretation of the resulting chromatograms, applying the [following mzBatch configuration](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dmso-meoh-extraction-evaluation/blob/9d98ba18332c9316a3f8d11c8f3bf25549dc62b8/docs/mapp_project_00067/mapp_batch_00173/results/mzmine/mapp_batch_00173_maclocal.mzbatch)\n\n## Results \n\n### Principal Component Analysis \n\nAs a first step, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and to explore the main sources of variance among the samples.\n\n![alt text](<bachelor_project_jade/Image 26.06.25 à 23.53.jpg>)\n*Figure 8 : PC1 (x-axis) accounts for 31.8% of the total variance in the dataset, while PC2 (y-axis) explains 15.5%. Each point represents one of the three methods applied to each of the six samples, with one color per species.* \n\n### Chromatograms analysis\n\nAs previously mentioned, the chromatograms of the samples tested using the three different methods were analyzed. However, given that the sonicated DMSO method did not yield significantly improved results compared to the simple DMSO extraction, only the chromatograms obtained from the methanol–water and simple DMSO methods are presented here for clarity.\n\nChromatographic profiles of extracts from the six species, obtained using methanol–water and DMSO extraction methods (represented by two colors), are superimposed to compare signal intensities and metabolic patterns as a function of retention time. The annotated peaks correspond to the majority compounds detected. \nFor each species, data from both positive and negative ionization modes are displayed. A single blank chromatogram is included for each ionization mode, serving as a reference for both extraction methods. \nThe annotated peaks correspond to the majority compounds detected. \n\n![alt text](<bachelor_project_jade/Image 24.06.25 à 17.28.jpg>)\n*Figure 9 : Positive ionization chromatograms obtained for Valeriana officinalis after extraction by two separate methods. 20250506_CVOL_dbgi_002560_02_01.mzML (magenta): methanol-water-formic acid method;

In some cases, there are slight differences in detection, and the peaks don't overlap perfectly, if at all.\n\nThe comparative chromatograms differ according to the ionization mode. \n\n## Discussion \n\n### Principal Component Analysis\n\nThe PCA shows that the variance between samples is mainly explain by taxon identity rather than by extraction method. For example, PC1, which explains 31.8% of the total variability, clearly separates *Erythroxylum coca* from the other species, while PC2, accounting for 15.5% of the variability, distinguishes *Valeriana officinalis* from the rest of the samples. Samples from the same species cluster together regardless of the extraction protocol used, suggesting that differences between methods have minimal impact on the overall variance. This similarity of chemical profiles within the same species confirms that the three extraction methods give comparable results for each species.\n\n### Chromatograms comparison \n\nThe regions where peaks overlap indicate that the same molecules were extracted at specific retention times. The vast majority of peaks are superimposed, suggesting a high similarity between the two extraction methods. Some molecules are better detected with DMSO, while others show improved detection with methanol; however, overall, the chromatograms are largely comparable and overlap with high precision.\n\nChromatograms obtained in positive and negative ionization modes are not directly comparable, as each mode favors the ionization of different molecules. Indeed, some molecules ionize better in positive mode, while others do so in negative mode, meaning that each mode detects a distinct subset of compounds present in the sample. \n\nThe detection of compounds is overall better in positive ionization mode, in terms of signal intensity , likely due to the nature of the molecules present, which often contain basic functional groups (such as amines) that favor positive ionization. However, negative mode should not be overlooked: although the signals are generally less intense, this mainly reflects a lower ionization efficiency rather than an intrinsically lower sensitivity of this mode. In addition, negative mode enables the detection of certain compounds absent in positive mode, highlighting the importance of using both ionization modes complementarily to obtain a complete and accurate profile of the molecules present in the extracts and achieve optimal metabolomic coverage.<sup><a href=\"#ref10\" id=\"note10\">10</a></sup>\n\n### Sample characteristics and preparation\n\nSeveral notable differences were observed between samples extracted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and those extracted with methanol. First, DMSO freezes at 19°C and is solid at -80°C, whereas methanol freezes at around -98°C and remains liquid at -80°C. Using DMSO as the extraction liquid requires additional thawing time, since samples can only be handled in the liquid phase. Furthermore, extracts obtained with DMSO foam after shaking and are significantly darker in color. However, almost all of the foam disappears during centrifugation. This enables the correct extraction of the supernatant without aspirating foam along with it.\n\n![alt text](<bachelor_project_jade/Image 25.06.25 à 12.05.jpg>)\n*Figure 23 : Eppendorf tubes before centrifugation containing 2 extracts of Erythroxylum coca by 2 extraction methods; Left: DMSO extraction: Right: methanol-water-formic acid extraction.*\n\nSonication was employed in combination with DMSO for the third extraction method, as it enables the release of intracellular metabolites by lysing cell membranes. It relies on ultrasonic waves to generate bubbles in a liquid, which, upon implosion, produce high localized pressures and temperatures, thereby disrupting biological structures such as cellular membranes.<sup><a href=\"#ref9\" id=\"note9\">9</a></sup>\n\nThe initial hypothesis was that DMSO combined with sonication would yield mass spectrometry outputs of comparable quality to those obtained with methanol-based solvents, since sonication facilitates extensive cell disruption and maximizes compound recovery for analysis. However, sonicated DMSO produced results of similar—or even lower—quality than DMSO alone. This suggests, on one hand, that DMSO is highly effective as a standalone extraction solvent, and on the other hand, that combining sonication with DMSO may potentially damage biological structures beyond the cell membranes in our extracts. Further analyses or a reduction in sonication time could be considered for the protocol, to observe whether results are better, similar, or again of poorer quality.\n\n## Perspectives\n\n### Conversion of libraries to 96-well format\n\nIn order to submit our natural product extracts to bioassay screening by external bioanalytical laboratories, it is essential to provide the samples in a format compatible with such analyses. To this end, we are currently reformatting our extract libraries in a 69-well configuration.\n\nThis reformatting step will be integrated with our ongoing results on DMSO-based extraction, thereby enabling us to refine our methodologies and improve sample compatibility for downstream bioassays and bioactive compound discovery.\n\nThe currently considered format for the 96-well libraries is the [AlteTube™ Screw Cap 2D Barcoded Tubes – External Thread – 96 SBS Rack](https://www.altemislab.com/2d-barcoded-tubes/external-thread-tubes-96-sbs-rack/). Further evaluation will determine its suitability for both our sample types and the subsequent bioanalytical workflows.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe comparison of chromatograms obtained from the two extraction methods enabled the evaluation of the compounds detected using both DMSO- and methanol-based protocols. The results are highly promising: the near-perfect overlap of peaks indicates that simple DMSO extraction is as effective as the conventional methanol/water/formic acid mixture in recovering the molecules in our extracts. This finding opens the possibility of replacing the current solvent with DMSO in the extraction protocol. Combined with a 96-well format, this approach would allow for the reuse of extracted samples in high-throughput screening and facilitate the sharing of these extracts with other laboratories for bioactive compound discovery, thus aligning with one of EMI’s key objectives.\n\n# Fake extract project \n\nThe \"Fake Extract Project\" originated within the framework of Marco Visani’s doctoral thesis, with whom I worked during my bachelor’s degree. The doctoral project, rooted in the LOTUS and EMI initiatives, aims to anticipate the chemistry of life on Earth by modeling metabolites produced by living organisms and associating certain molecular patterns with biological characteristics. The study’s objective aligns with the goals of the open science LOTUS initiative, which seeks to construct referenced pairs between natural products and their source organisms, as well as with the objectives of EMI, one of which is to explore the yet unknown chemistry of life. The primary aim of this thesis, situated in a bioinformatics context, is to predict the chemical composition of living organisms across the tree of life in advance.\n\nOne of the major current challenges in metabolomic profiling of organisms within the EMI framework is that the molecular profile obtained by untargeted mass spectrometry from the natural extract does not allow for certainty regarding whether certain compounds were lost during the process. Without accurate, exhaustive, and well-referenced data throughout the extraction and profiling steps, it becomes difficult to anticipate the occurrences of natural products. This uncertainty limits the ability to model the chemical composition of living organisms according to their phylogenetic position.\n\nIonization in mass spectrometry is intrinsically competitive: only molecules with favorable physicochemical properties—such as polarity, basicity, acidity, molecular weight, or certain structural features—ionize efficiently. Others may be strongly disadvantaged by phenomena like ion suppression<sup><a href=\"#ref11\" id=\"note11\">11</a></sup>, leading to decreased or even absent signals in complex natural mixtures.\n\nTo model these losses and anticipate the missing chemistry within natural extracts, we designed the *Fake Extract Project*. This approach relies on the analysis of an artificial mixture composed of well-characterized reference compounds, processed through mass spectrometry. By comparing the output signal to the known initial composition, it becomes possible to quantify compound-specific detection losses. This strategy allows for the calibration and correction of experimental outputs by accounting for ionization biases, with the ultimate aim of more faithfully approximating the complete chemical composition of natural extracts.\n\n## ApexBio natural products library\n\nFirst, we considered using a well-characterized model plant from plant biology, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, for our known extract. However, we realized that even the metabolome of such a plant is neither well characterized nor well understood. Moreover, it is very complex. To overcome this problem, we created a \"fake extract\": a mixture of well-cataloged natural products whose chemical characteristics are known. This allows us to obtain an exact result of what was lost during the mass spectrometry run since the exact composition of the mixture is known from the beginning.\n\nTo this end, a natural product library from ApexBio ([DiscoveryProbe™ Natural Product Library](https://www.apexbt.com/discoveryprobetm-natural-product-library.html)), comprising 550 compounds, was selected. An accompanying Excel file containing key chemical properties was provided. Before using this library for our analyses and mixture preparation, we first verified the accuracy of the provided data, an essential step for reliable downstream work. In metabolomics, precise knowledge of molecular properties such as exact mass, SMILES, and other associated chemical data is crucial, as molecule detection and identification rely heavily on these parameters.\n\n## Material and methods \n\n### Data cleaning with python \n\nThe following [Excel file](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/c415e7ddad3ff961c79f32927e89771cff457f0c/apex_bio.xlsx) was provided to us, and an automated cleaning process using the Python programming language was necessary to ensure the accuracy of all chemical data associated with the molecules before further analysis.\n\nInitially, a [Molecule](https://github.com/commons-research/apex_bio_data_cleaning/blob/d5994545b8830bd76031a3fe6423795bff2624af/molecules.py) class was developed to compare the submitted data for each molecule against the [PubChem chemical database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), and to extract additional chemical information related to each compound of interest. This class was then imported in the [cleaned_dataframe.ipynb Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/commons-research/apex_bio_data_cleaning/blob/d5994545b8830bd76031a3fe6423795bff2624af/cleaned_dataframe.ipynb) to generate TSV files corresponding to molecules that could not be retrieved from PubChem, specifically, [20 molecules not found using their CAS number](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/c415e7ddad3ff961c79f32927e89771cff457f0c/failed_cas.csv), [3 not found using their item name](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/c415e7ddad3ff961c79f32927e89771cff457f0c/failed_iname.csv), and [1 not found using its SMILES representation](https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/c415e7ddad3ff961c79f32927e89771cff457f0c/failed_smiles.csv). These three identifiers were selected because they are considered to have the highest likelihood of matching a unique entry in the database.\n\nDue to the significant amount of time required to clean our molecular data, and the notable inconsistencies in the associated chemical information, we only had time to analyze a single plate. This experiment therefore served as a pilot for the \"fake extract project,\" allowing us to test the planned methodologies and dilutions, and refine them if necessary.\n\nFor this purpose, a plate with accurate and reliable associated data was selected, here [plate number 3](https://github.com/commons-research/fake-extract-plate-3-mix/blob/31e0a5dc0a8b001220e97089405a5284476099be/plate_3_targets.csv), whose information proved to be correct. While a standard 96-well plate contains 88 molecules (with one column left empty), 89 molecules were analyzed in total, as picrotoxin is an equimolar mixture of two compounds. These molecules were first detected individually. Then, a mixture of the 89 molecules was created and designated as the \"fake extract.\" \n\nSubsequently, a [revised file](https://github.com/commons-research/apex_bio_data_cleaning/blob/d5994545b8830bd76031a3fe6423795bff2624af/apex_bio_revised.tsv) was provided, from which the [apex_bio_cleaned.tsv](https://github.com/commons-research/apex_bio_data_cleaning/blob/d5994545b8830bd76031a3fe6423795bff2624af/apex_bio_cleaned.tsv) file was generated. The chemical data in this file are accurate and will serve as a reference for analyzing the other plates in the next stages of the project.\n\n### Preparation of diluted samples for mass spectrometry analysis\n\nAll 96-well V-bottom plates from the natural product library are stored at -80°C with a heat-sealed aluminum foil. Once the seal is removed, a reusable silicone lid is applied to keep the plate closed and allow further storage at -80°C for subsequent analyses. Dilutions were carried out from the source plate into an identically formatted 96-well V-bottom plate.\n\nThe initial concentration of the received samples was 10 millimolar (10,000 micromolar). Therefore, several test dilutions were required prior to mass spectrometry analysis to determine the optimal concentration for molecule detection. The first column (well positions 01A–01H) of source plate number 3 was diluted in DMSO at various concentrations on a daughter plate as follows:\n\n* Row 01A–H (Samples 1): 100 µM (1 µL of original sample + 99 µL DMSO)\n* Row 02A–H (Samples 2): 10 µM (10 µL of Sample 1 + 90 µL DMSO)\n* Row 03A–H: 1 µM (10 µL of Sample 2 + 90 µL DMSO)\n* Row 04A–H: Blank control, DMSO only\n\nThe relative well positions from the source plate were preserved on the daughter plate (e.g., sample from well 01A in the source plate was diluted into well 01A of the daughter plate, and so on). The source plate was then resealed with a silicone lid and stored at −80 °C.\n\nFollowing mass spectrometry analysis, a concentration of 10 µM was selected as optimal. To dilute the 10 mM stock solutions directly to 10 µM, a 0.1 µL aliquot would have been needed for dilution into 99.9 µL of DMSO. However, such a small volume is prone to pipetting error and reduced accuracy.\n\nTo mitigate this, a two-step dilution protocol was adopted, involving the preparation of two daughter plates: one at 100 µM and another at 10 µM. The first daughter plate (100 µM) was obtained by diluting the source plate samples, and the second (10 µM) was prepared by diluting the 100 µM daughter plate samples. An 8-channel multichannel pipette was used, as a total of 88 wells were processed.\n\nFor the first daughter plate (100 µM), 99 µL of DMSO was dispensed into each of the 88 wells. Then, 1 µL of each sample from source plate 3 was transferred into the corresponding well, starting from column 11 to column 01 to avoid cross-contamination. Each transfer was followed by mixing via pipetting. The source plate was then resealed with a silicone lid and stored again at −80 °C.\n\nFor the second daughter plate (10 µM), 90 µL of DMSO was dispensed into each well, followed by 10 µL of sample from the 100 µM daughter plate. Samples were transferred from left to right, maintaining well-to-well correspondence and mixing after each transfer. Both daughter plates were sealed with silicone lids and stored at −80 °C.\n\nThe 10 µM daughter plate was then used for mass spectrometry analysis to detect individual compounds from source plate 3.\n\nFor the preparation of a mixed sample (our \"fake\" extract), the 100 µM daughter plate was reused. A 10 µL aliquot from each well was pooled and combined with 120 µL of DMSO in a reagent trough. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 2 mL vial, and then into a second vial equipped with an insert, for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. This yielded a final concentration of 1 µM per compound, which was sufficient for detection by mass spectrometry.\n\n### Targeted mass spectrometry \n\nThe samples (both individual compounds and the mixture of 89 molecules) were analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine which compounds were detected. The workflow was identical to that [described above](#untargeted-mass-spectrometry), using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition (DDA). However, unlike the analysis of unknown natural product extracts, this process was performed in a targeted manner. In this case, the identities of the compounds present at the outset were already known, and the goal was specifically to assess whether these known molecules could be detected after the mass spectrometry run, hence the targeted approach.\n\n### Evaluation of extractions\n\nFor the detection of specific individual molecules and the mixture, the raw data files generated from the mass spectrometry runs were processed using MZmine, applying the appropriate mzBatch configurations for both [positive](https://github.com/commons-research/fake-extract-plate-3-mix/blob/31e0a5dc0a8b001220e97089405a5284476099be/rt_extraction_pos_new.mzbatch) and [negative](https://github.com/commons-research/fake-extract-plate-3-mix/blob/31e0a5dc0a8b001220e97089405a5284476099be/rt_extraction_neg_new.mzbatch) ionization modes.\n\n## Results \n\nThe results for molecule detection in the mixture are presented here as a Venn diagram showing the molecules detected exclusively in positive ionization mode, exclusively in negative ionization mode, in both modes, or in neither. The corresponding [CSV file](https://github.com/commons-research/fake-extract-plate-3-mix/blob/31e0a5dc0a8b001220e97089405a5284476099be/plate_3_targets_detected.csv), from which the Venn diagram was generated, is also provided.\n\n![alt text](bachelor_project_jade/output.png)\n\n*Figure 24. Venn diagram showing the number of molecules detected from the mix of 89 compounds across the two ionization modes. Thirty-four molecules were detected exclusively in positive ionization mode, seven exclusively in negative mode, and twenty-nine in both modes. Nineteen molecules were not detected in either mode.*\n\nThe results show that, after analysis of the fake extract by mass spectrometry for natural product detection, 38.2% of the molecules were detected exclusively in positive ionization mode, 7.8% exclusively in negative mode, and 32.5% in both modes. A total of 21.5% of the molecules were not detected in either ionization mode. Overall, 78.5% of the compounds in the mix were detected at least once, depending on the ionization mode used during mass spectrometric analysis.\n\n## Discussions and conclusion\n\nThe 21.5% of molecules that were not detected even once in the mix confirm a significant ion suppression effect in extracts composed of multiple natural products. As a result, a certain amount of data is inevitably lost during the workflow for molecule extraction and metabolomic profiling, highlighting the need for modeling and characterization of these missing data. This would allow such biases to be integrated into the final outputs, bringing the predicted chemistry of living organisms closer to reality.\n\nHowever, these results should be interpreted with caution, as considerable variability was observed depending on the different MzMine parameter settings tested—particularly due to tolerance thresholds. Further in-depth analyses will be required in the next steps of the project in order to construct a mzBatch pipeline that is as accurate as possible for the detection of individual molecules, both alone and in mixtures, and that best reflects the true number of detectable compounds. A sufficiently high detection threshold is essential to ensure the detection of relevant compounds, but an excessively high threshold may result in the loss of weakly ionizable molecules.\n\nA major difference in detection was also observed between positive and negative ionization modes, again indicating a higher detection rate for positively ionized compounds (28.2%). Nonetheless, 7.8% of molecules were detected exclusively in negative mode, underlining its essential role in ensuring the broadest possible compound coverage. This observation is consistent with earlier discussions related to the results of the \"[DMSO project](#chromatograms-comparison).\"\n\n## Perspectives \n\nPlate 3 and its 88 wells were analyzed in this study, enabling the quantification of data loss during the workflow for a mixture of 89 molecules. In the next stages of the project, it will be essential to analyze the remaining individual plates to continue assessing data loss. Initially, each plate will be analyzed separately; subsequently, a combined mixture of all samples will be prepared and analyzed to cover the entire ApexBio library received—comprising 550 molecules—and evaluate the behavior of the full mixture.\n\nIn the future, a reliable and comprehensive characterization of data loss in mass spectrometry could allow for more precise identification of the types of molecules that systematically go undetected, particularly those that are weakly ionizable. This would pave the way for reconstructing the theoretical complete metabolomic profile of an extract—integrating not only the compounds that were detected but also those that may have been absent from the signal due to their physicochemical properties. Such an approach would make it possible to adjust and correct experimental profiles by incorporating the \"missing\" component, ultimately leading to a more accurate representation of the true chemical composition of organisms.\n\nThe results of this pilot project, once finalized, could be reused in the context of Marco Visani’s doctoral thesis. Indeed, this more accurate evaluation of the metabolomic profiles of the studied organisms would significantly improve the ability to anticipate the chemical composition of living organisms across the tree of life. Complete metabolomic profiles would allow the development of predictive models: based on a detailed chemical profile of a given organism, it would be possible, through extrapolation, to predict the likely chemistry of phylogenetically related organisms, even if they have not yet been experimentally studied. These enriched data could subsequently be integrated into the EMI and LOTUS initiatives, to refine the association between natural products and their source organisms, and thus contribute to a more complete and realistic characterization of the chemistry of life.\n\n# Bibliography \n\n<p id=\"ref1\">1. : Aron, A.
