# This is Simon's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.

Today is 2025.03.05
First day doing some sampling for the project.

Learned how to sample:
 -  Geolocalise the position of the sample through the QField app.
 - Take pictures of the whole plant, typical organs/allowing hints for identification, the panel, the panel and the serial number of the falcon tube.
 - Do the cutting
 - Put the plant matter in a filter, shove the package in the tube, get the tube in liquid nitrogen
 - Repeat for a different organ (leaves, stem, flower, fruit, whole plant) on the same species, or change species

When done with the sampling, go to the big freezer. Take the tubes out of the nitrogen, and put them in a plastic bag (20 per bag).

As of now, we should ask Stefanie Ranf for permission to use the lyophylisation machine. Ironically, the  machine needs to be warmed up before use. It needs up to 3 days to do its work.

The sampling of the plants in the orangerie is still in progress. However, something like 1/3 of the plants have been sampled already. The first eastern rows are completed.
