## Daily report (What did I learn?)
- made a new "course" entry about mongodb
- learned about mongodb with pickaxe, that some how it can have problems when you generate images. It will not write in to the database, because of a system error.
- I don't know, how to verify the output and even how I can looking for that. 
- [Mongo University](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-mongodb) maybe it's worth it to check it out.



## Future perspective
- try to understand pickaxe a little bit better (maybe reread the paper...)
