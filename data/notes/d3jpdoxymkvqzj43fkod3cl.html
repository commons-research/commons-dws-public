<p>Today I will try to do a little package to calculate predicted next molecules.</p>
<p>Multiprocessing package (from pyhton):</p>
<p>Today helped me Marco Visani a lot. We tried out the minedataset module, what should be my masterthesis.
We did some different filters and run in problems, which was a little bit unexpected.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>I was working in the fork folder with my script, which isn't the smartest idea.</li>
<li>I was working in the forkfolder and had additionaly installed <strong>minedatabase</strong> as a package in poetry. This doesn't make any sense, because I want to work in the forkfolder (copy of minedatabase)...</li>
<li>with the command <code>poetry add git+&#x3C;website></code> it is possible to add packages, which are not from pip. This what we have to do with our fork. </li>
<li>Somehow, it didn't worked. The solution was to rename the mainfolder minedatabase -> mine_database. Additionaly we had to run <code>poetry build</code> in the folder, to make kind of a package out of it. With poetry show, we could see it added the package which was not from pipy. </li>
<li>I realised, when I installing packages, they will be also available for pyenv. Better said, poetry uses pyenv for this. The problem is, that I have multiple packages working on that pyenv... I have to find a solution.</li>
</ul>
