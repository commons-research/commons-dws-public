<p>Wrote a book on Michael Polanyi</p>
<p>Books by Polanyi</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Knowledge</li>
<li>The Tacit Dimension</li>
<li>Science, Faith and Society</li>
</ul>
<p>Tacit: unspecifiable and implicit aspects of knowledge, accepted incritically
e.g. riding a bike, playing the piano, but also reading, writing, speaking a language</p>

<li>Michael Polanyi, the scientist who wanted to re-enchant the world</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi" title="Michael Polanyi  ( poh-LAN-yee; Hungarian: Polányi Mihály; 11 March 1891 – 22 February 1976) was a Hungarian-British polymath, who made important theoretical contributions to physical chemistry, economics, and philosophy. He argued that positivism is a false account of knowing.
His wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases. He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934. He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils won the Nobel Prize, as well as one of his children. In 1944 Polanyi was elected to the Royal Society.
The contributions which Polanyi made to the social sciences include the concept of a polycentric spontaneous order and his rejection of a value neutral conception of liberty. They were developed in the context of his opposition to central planning.">Michael Polanyi</a></p>
<p>Theory of personal knowledge
Polanyi anti-reductionism</p>
<p>Standard model of Science : objectivism</p>
<p>Moral inversion: immoral actions are justified by the moral good they serve (e.g. Nazism, Stalinism)</p>
<p>Maybe to connect with Carlo Rovelli's work on the nature of time and the nature of knowledge</p>
<p>In 1993, in collaboration with Alain Connes, Rovelli proposed a solution to this problem called the thermal time hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, time emerges only in a thermodynamic or statistical context. If this is correct, the flow of time is not fundamental, deriving from the incompleteness of knowledge.</p>

<p>Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions after listening Polanyi's lectures</p>
<p>Personal knowledge is NOT subjectivism</p>
<ul>
<li>realism: there is an external reality outside of us </li>
<li>submission to shared standards (responsability) e.g apply the scientific method</li>
<li>intersubjectivity: </li>
<li>universal intent: </li>
</ul>
<p>Polanyi's anti-reductionism</p>
<p>Notion of emergence</p>
<p>Concept of dual control. </p>
<p>Polanyi's is post-critical philosophy.</p>
