## Meetings
~13:00 PM was in the office




## Daily report (What did I learn?)
I installed **Data warrior** (<https://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/download.html>), which is a tool developped for looking at molecules. It's written in Java and can show the molecules as a 2D or 3D structure. The helppage is quiet big.

Tomorrow I will have to read again the paper and try again the different filters.
