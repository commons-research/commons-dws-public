<p><em>SDF (Simple Data Format)</em> : Simple Data Format is a file format used by numerical modelers. It was invented by George H. Fisher of the Space Sciences Lab at UC Berkeley in 2007.<br>
The format's goal was to provide a way of reading and writing output data from numerical simulations that preserve full precision. Furthermore, the format is simple, easy to use, and supports files of several gigabytes.</p>
<p>for request commands like <em>GET and </em>POST we should always raise an error, if the status has some problems...
