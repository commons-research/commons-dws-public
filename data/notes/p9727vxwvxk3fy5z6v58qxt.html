<p>NPR articles are designed to give an interesting insight into the topic, focussing on the key developments that have shaped a field rather than giving a very comprehensive overview of all results. Authors are encouraged to include their own perspective on developments, trends and future directions.
Before commissioning articles for NPR we ask that authors provide a brief synopsis. This is circulated to members of the editorial board for comment.  </p>
