<p>IMPORTANT NEWS:
The sample collected until now by me (tree stuff), and Jade and Héloïse (geophytes) are all mixed up in tube racks. That is problematic because its complicated to differenciate them even by using the database. They should be separated before entering the lc-ms to be placed in different libraries. My samples will go in a dedicated library (tree) where they could be compared. As Jade's one will go together. This will allow us to have a picture representing all of our work for the presentation.
Wether the separation can be done before creating the aliquots or later in the extraction process is unknown.
=> I will have to ask Edouard
Thats a bit annoying for I already weighted some geophytes.
Maybe I could ask Héloïse or Jade to weight some samples or prepare alicots (+-40 samples on their side?)</p>
<p>New QR codes must be installed in due place of the old "specimen" ones. The way it was made makes it easier to follow the progression of the sampling of the organs of a speciment or a species. Much more readable than my sign system.</p>
