## Meetings
With PM:
- Readme is as much important then code <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/>
- no hardcoded paths! Use this package <https://github.com/cthoyt/zenodo-client>
- not only random sampeling. Also possibility to specify taxanomy...

## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Today I tried mkdocs. It is a cool and easy way to build a documentation. At least they claim that.
I am not there now. MKDocs should have the possibility to read your code and automatically use this for documentation.
It can generates HTML sites, which can be used for publishing.

## Future perspective
I like to make a LOTUS module, for my code stuff. It works, but my 209 lines of code are not easly readable anymore.
