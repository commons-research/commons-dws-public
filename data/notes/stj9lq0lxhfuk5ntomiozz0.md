## Resume

This project will aim to establish an expanded and pertinent chemical space of NPs through the generation of novel plausible chemical structure.
For this we will exploit the initial set of know NPs chemical structure found in LOTUS and employ tools such as Pickaxe to proceed to the in silico metabolization of the initial set of NPs.
