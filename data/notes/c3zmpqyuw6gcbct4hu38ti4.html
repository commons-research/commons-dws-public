<p>Inoculation with AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi).</p>
<p>Phylum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomeromycota" title="Glomeromycota (often referred to as glomeromycetes, as they include only one class, Glomeromycetes) are one of eight currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the thalli of bryophytes and the roots of vascular land plants. Not all species have been shown to form AMs, and one, Geosiphon pyriformis, is known not to do so. Instead, it forms an endocytobiotic association with Nostoc cyanobacteria. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are dependent on land plants (Nostoc in the case of Geosiphon) for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.
According to multigene phylogenetic analyses, this taxon is located as a member of the phylum Mucoromycota. Currently, the phylum name Glomeromycota is invalid, and the subphylum Glomeromycotina should be used to describe this taxon.">Glomeromycota</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigolactone" title="Strigolactones are a group of chemical compounds produced by roots of plants. Due to their mechanism of action, these molecules have been classified as plant hormones or phytohormones. So far, strigolactones have been identified to be responsible for three different physiological processes: First, they promote the germination of parasitic organisms that grow in the host plant&#x27;s roots, such as Striga lutea and other plants of the genus Striga. Second, strigolactones are fundamental for the recognition of the plant by symbiotic fungi, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, because they establish a mutualistic association with these plants, and provide phosphate and other soil nutrients. Third, strigolactones have been identified as branching inhibition hormones in plants; when present, these compounds prevent excess bud growing in stem terminals, stopping the branching mechanism in plants.
Strigolactones comprise a diverse group, but they all have core common chemical structure, as shown in the image to the right. The structure is based on a tricyclic lactone linked to a hydroxymethyl butenolide; the former is represented in the figure as the A-B-C part, while the latter is the D part of the molecule. It is important to note that most strigolactones present variations in the ABC part, but the D ring is quite constant across the different species, which led researchers to suspect that the biological activity relies on this part of the molecule. Different studies have demonstrated that the activity of the molecules is lost when the C-D section of the molecules is modified.Since strigolactones are involved in the signaling pathway required for germination of parasitic species (such as Striga sp.), they have been a proposed target to control pests and overgrowth of these parasitic organism. Using a molecule similar to strigolactones could be the key to designing a chemical and biological mechanism to stop the colonization of a plant&#x27;s root by parasitic plants.">Strigolactone</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrikin" title="Karrikins are a group of plant growth regulators found in the smoke of burning plant material. Karrikins help stimulate seed germination and plant development because they mimic a signaling hormone known as strigolactone. Strigolactones are hormones that help increase growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil, which enhances plant growth and leads to an increase in plant branching.Smoke from wildfires or bushfires has been known for a long time to stimulate the germination of seeds. In 2004, the butenolide karrikinolide (KAR1) was shown to be responsible for this effect. Later, several closely related compounds were discovered in smoke, and are collectively known as karrikins.">Karrikin</a> </p>

<p>Honeypots ants</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecocystus_mexicanus" title="Myrmecocystus mexicanus is a species of ant in the genus Myrmecocystus, which is one of the six genera that bear the common name &#x22;honey ant&#x22; or &#x22;honeypot ant&#x22;, due to curious behavior where some of the workers will swell with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of nest chambers, acting as living food storage for the colony.   Honey ants are found in North America, Australia, and Africa. Ant species belonging to the genus Myrmecocystus reside in North America.  M. mexicanus in particular is found in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.">Myrmecocystus mexicanus</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecocystus" title="Myrmecocystus is a North American genus of ants in the subfamily Formicinae. It is one of five genera that includes honeypot ants. Worker ants keep and tend plerergates, which are other ants that store large quantities of nutritious fluid in their abdomens to feed the colony during famine times. Some species engage in highly territorial tournaments, which can result in intraspecific slavery. During the raids, they carry off larvae, workers, and plerergates.">Myrmecocystus</a></p>
