## Daily report (What did I learn?)
I've got a Mail from Lisa Jeske (Brenda Database). 

1. take the structure file (molfile) from Brenda
2. Convert it to a SMART (https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/molconvert_index.md)
3. annotate it with the organism

I wanted to find out, how the mines database is build (where is the code?).
The paper <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-015-0087-1> provides some information about it. 
Also a Github account is given: <https://github.com/JamesJeffryes/MINE-API>.
But it is not possible to find the code, how they put the reactions togheter. 
It looks like they are working with the BNICE methode (database?) which is comming from the University of Lausanne.

To get access to the BNICE database, you have to sign up. This you can only do, if you are a professor.
