## Notes
* read paper [*Can phylogeny predict chemical diversity and potential medicinal activity of plants? A case study of amaryllidaceae*](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-182)
  * from that paper they say that there is a **lack** of congruence between specialized chemistry and phylogeny may be caused by several different phenomena. One of them is convergent evolution. $\rightarrow$ we need to take this into account in our model. 


* [*Combining Evolutionary Inference and Metabolomics to Identify Plants With Medicinal Potential*](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00267) 
  * "Recent research on plant phylogeny coupled with metabolomics, which is the comprehensive analysis of metabolite profiles, has identified that related taxa produce similar secondary metabolites, **although correlations are dependent also on environmental factors.** "
  * interesting article stating that there is a need for creating a model such as what we are doing. We shouldn't forget to include environmental variable. It seems crucial.
