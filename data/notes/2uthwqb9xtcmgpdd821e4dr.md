# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.03.03


## Notes
* After long discussion with Pierre-Marie and Daniel, we agreed on:
  * 2 main properties are "molecules" and "species"
  * Adding another dimension like "tissue" or "environment" is important
    * Finding which one to add is not of our concern for now.
  * We could increase to how many properties as we want but what is the scientific relevance of doing that ? For now it would make sense just to keep the tissue


## Todo today
* Continue on generalization of the model, find a way to increase properties to an infinite number of dimensions
* Correct nomenclature and keep the same for the rest of the model. 
* Try to write Hastings ratio to update our parameters

## Doing
* continue on the "upper" part of the model


## Done



## Todo tomorrow
