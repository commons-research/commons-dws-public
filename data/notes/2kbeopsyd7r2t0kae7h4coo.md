## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Today I got the advice to look for the rules (general and intermediat). The goal is to change the rules, depending on the organism.

So for the moment I didn't dig more into the feasibility filter. I stopped by the "_choose_items_to_filter" function, which was correct, but somehow the filtering still doesn't work. I should look into it a little bit more maybe later.

For the reaction rules I found following information:
./MINE-Database/mine_database/data/metacyc_rules/
metacyc_intermediate_rules.tsv - 7359 lines ()
metacyc_generalized_rules.tsv - 1225 lines (JN1224min from <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.02.006>)

the loaded rules in pickaxe is the generalized_rules (./MINE-Database/mine_database/rules.py).
