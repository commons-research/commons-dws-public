## Meetings
I was running over the weekend the first generation for the full dataset LOTUS.
The job failes because of "OUT_OF_MEMORY". 
Also I had the following error message:  
[23:59:30] Maximum product count hit 10000, stopping reaction early...  
[23:59:47] WARNING: could not find number of expected rings. Switching to an approximate ring finding algorithm.
