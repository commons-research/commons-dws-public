It is widespread across much of the world.This plant has cylindrical, grayish roots. Solid, circular, purplish stems with white fine hairs 0.8m. Leaves arranged in opposite pairs, hairy in two-sided, lanceolate, serrated 2–12.5 cm long, 5-35 mm wide.
The solitary flower heads are 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) in diameter, with white florets. The bumpy achenes are compressed and narrowly winged. This species grows commonly in moist places in warm temperate to tropical areas worldwide. It is widely distributed throughout India, Nepal, China, Thailand,Bangladesh and Brazil.">Eclipta alba</a>)</li>

<p>Presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coumestan" title="Coumestan is a heterocyclic organic compound.  Coumestan forms the central core of a variety of natural compounds known collectively as coumestans.  Coumestans are oxidation products of pterocarpan that are similar to coumarin.  Coumestans, including coumestrol, a phytoestrogen, are found in a variety of plants. Food sources high in coumestans include split peas, pinto beans, lima beans, and especially alfalfa and clover sprouts.Coumestrol has about the same binding affinity for the ER-β estrogen receptor as 17β-estradiol, but much less affinity than 17α-estradiol, although the estrogenic potency of coumestrol at both receptors is much less than that of 17β-estradiol.Because of the estrogenic activity of some coumestans, a variety of syntheses have been developed that allow the preparation of coumestans so that their pharmacological effects can be explored.">coumestan</a> </p>

<p>Q : why such difference in the raw extracts conc used for testing ?
Q : can you explain the heatmap again ?
Q : stats significative diff
Q : how did you annotate the compounds ? Which software ? Which DB ?</p>

Their garden hybrids and cultivars have been popular among gardeners, beginning with Clematis &#x27;Jackmanii&#x27;, a garden standby since 1862; more cultivars are being produced constantly. They are mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin. Most species are known as clematis in English, while some are also known as traveller&#x27;s joy, a name invented for the sole British native, C. vitalba, by the herbalist John Gerard; virgin&#x27;s bower for C. terniflora, C. virginiana, and C. viticella; old man&#x27;s beard, applied to several with prominent seedheads; leather flower for those with fleshy petals; or vase vine for the North American Clematis viorna.">Clematis</a></p>
