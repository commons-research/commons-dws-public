## Done
Learned the processing step following the use of the lyophilisator:
- Take the rack of falcon tubes, the bottle of small metal bolls, tweezers, gloves in the lab next to the balance.
- Scan the falcon tube of the sample with the tablet
- Put +-500 micrograms of a semple in the very small tube. Confirm the weight on the tablet. It should print out an etiquette
- Add 3 metal balls in the tube. Be wary of not contaminating the tweezers by touching the tube
- Close the tube. Stick the etiquette onto it. 
- Disinfect the gloves, and the tweezers
- Rinse and repeat
Be weary of cross-contaminations
