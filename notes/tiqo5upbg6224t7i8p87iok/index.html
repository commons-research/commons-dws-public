<p>Have a look at <a href="http://berkeleybop.github.io/best_practice/">http://berkeleybop.github.io/best_practice/</a></p>
<p>This is the best practice / house style guide for the BBOP group. Inspired by / cribbed from Knocean practice and other sources.</p>
<p>Source: berkeleybop/berkeleybop.github.io/blob/master/best_practice</p>
<p>We are a diverse group working on many different projects with different stakeholders and sets of collaborators. Nevertheless we strive to follow a set of core best practices so we can be most efficient and develop the highest quality code, ontologies, standards, schemas, and analyses.</p>
<p>This document may be overwhelming at first but as you become more familiar with projects it should become second nature. If there is anything you don’t understand, ask on slack!</p>
<p>Git and GitHub
use git ubiquitously
commit early, commit often
perfect later!
you should always be working on a branch, so don’t worry about breaking things
make a PR for your branch - mark as draft if not ready
Make repos public by default
Use standard repo layouts
choose a cookiecutter
monarch-project-template for code-oriented projects
don’t reinvent
look at exemplars
Include standard files:
README.md
LICENSE (BSD3 or Apache preferred for software)
CONTRIBUTING.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (see for example kgx CoC
Changes.md
.gitignore
Makefile or equivalent
see below for more specific recommendations for specific kinds of repos
use GitHub
Like GitLab in principle, but GitHub has network effect
prefer to work on the main repo, not forks, but defer to project-specific guidelines
Read our GitHub Overview
Use GitHub issues
in general you should always be working to a ticket assigned to you
try to assign every issue to somebody
try to have a single assignee / responsible person
tag people if necessary
note: if you tag me with <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@cmungall (Private)</a> it’s likely I won’t see it. alert me to a ticket via slack if I am required
use GitHub’s default labels: bug, question, enhancement, good first issue, etc.
set up standard issue templates (helps ensure tickets are auto-assigned)
When creating issues:
give a meaningful issue title
word title as a bug, e.g. “under condition X, Y fails” or a request, e.g. “add option A to method B”
give issue actionable descriptions, make it clear when an issue can be closed
see Seth’s suggestions for creating awesome issues
use GitHub Pull Requests
read the obook PR review guide
mark as draft until ready for review, then assign reviewers
description should link to an issue (“Resolves #1234”) to automatically close issue when PR is merged
otherwise you have to clean up issues manually
update description as needed
always look over your commits before making a PR
are there unexpected changes? You should only see YOUR changes
Is it adding files unexpectedly? Some git clients are eager to do this
are some changes not recognizable as yours? Be careful not to clobber
follow repo-standard practice for rebase etc
AVOID:
making PRs too large
mixing orthogonal concerns in one PR. Generally 1 PR = 1 issue
mixing in formatting changes on sections of the code unrelated to the semantic changes you are making
working on a PR for too long a time without feedback from others
working on “invisible” branches. ALWAYS make a PR, ALWAYS push. You can mark as draft!
give PRs a meaningful title and description
remember: titles will be used when auto-making release notes
use GitHub Milestones to plan releases
use GitHub Releases to tag versions and attach binaries
use semver (except for ontologies)
use the auto-generate release notes feature
corollary: write informative PR titles and never commit on main
if making a non-patch release, select the previous minor/major to diff from
use GitHub Pages for simple static content and documentation
prefer the docs/ directory option
See exemplars: OAK, Biolink Model
use GitHub Projects (“project boards”) for coordinating issues and PRs
three columns:
To do: for manager to fill and prioritize
In progress: for developer to keep up-to-date
Ready for review: for manager to empty
order of preference for cards: PR link, issue link, text
set up GitHub actions to do CI
Migrate if you are on an old travis repo
All changes should be on PRs thus validated
main branch should never ever be failing
EVERY repo should have actions and PR checking
set up GitHub teams
default to public membership
make sure it is clear who has permission to merge PRs
set up badges
always: CI
pypi, downloads, codecov, zenodo, …
Configure the “About” (see gear icon on right)
use standard topics
biolink
linkml
obofoundry
monarchinitiative
geneontology
Orgs
define a standard topic (see above)
include a .github
examplar: github.com/linkml
pin repos
make sure all relevant artefacts are checked in
use git status and .gitignore
in general avoid checking in derived products (but see below)
avoid checking in .xslx files (use TSVs; or consider cogs instead)
versioning
do not check in files with version numbers e.g. foo.v1.txt into GitHub - git does versioning for you
use the GitHub release mechanism
use ISO-8601 or semver schemes (see guidelines on specific repo types below)
tend your repos
remove cruft such as obsolete files (GitHub preserves history)
avoid random stuff at top level
keep README in sync
avoid using spaces in filenames
always use standard suffixes (e.g. .tsv, .txt, .md)
kabob-case-is-a-good-default.txt. See filenames in google developer guide
Don’t rename files and commit - use “git mv” instead, so that the history of the file is preserved
use topics and “star” relevant repos
<a href="https://github.com/topics/linkml">https://github.com/topics/linkml</a>
<a href="https://github.com/topics/obofoundry">https://github.com/topics/obofoundry</a>
<a href="https://github.com/topics/geneontology">https://github.com/topics/geneontology</a>
<a href="https://github.com/topics/monarchinitiative">https://github.com/topics/monarchinitiative</a>
always star your own repos
star your colleagues and collaborator’s repos
tips
the gh github cli client is very useful, e.g. gh pr Software:
Nico recommends gh Desktop
Code-centric Repos
Use an existing repo from a group member as template for best practice, e.g.,
kgx
linkml
OAK
Or better: monarch project cookiecutter
Include a README.md
provide sufficient context
don’t boil the ocean - put reference material in a separate reference guide
include examples and use examples as tests
Create reference documentation using RTD/Sphinx
let inline docstrings in Python do most of the work for you
read writethedocs
Include installation instructions
use an OSI approved LICENSE, BSD3 preferred
Use unit tests
consult others on framework
Use GitHub-integrated CI
formerly Travis
use GitHub actions
Release code to PyPI or appropriate repo
use GitHub releases
use GitHub actions to trigger releases to PyPI
use GitHub actions to trigger releases to PyPI
see nmdc-schema as exemplar
make release notes automatically see github guide
relies on using PRs with well-described titles
always have multiple owners of a pypi package on the pypi site
use standard semver, start from 0.1.0, move to 1.0.0 when stable
Consider a Dockerfile
For ETL repos, follow standard templates for
kg-hub
koza
For ETL repos
Use Jenkins pipelines
Badges
CI
Code coverage
PyPI
TODO: ADD MORE
Schema/Standards-centric Repos, Data and metadata repos
Use LinkML
Create repo from LinkML template
Examples:
NMDC
MIxS
GFF3 linkml
chemkg/chemrof
Register with w3id.org
Include comprehensive examples
Use LinkML mkdocs framework
Understand the difference between OWL-centric and KG-centric modeling
include mappings to Biolink Model
always include examples
integrate these with documentation
integrate these with unit tests
also include counter-examples
data deliberately designed to fail validation
check validation correctly identifiers these in github actions
enable zenodo syncing
For repos that have data:
consider a dashboard (see semantic dashbaord patterns)
Ontology-centric Repos
Use ODK seed
Register ontology with OBO if appropriate
include detailed metadata
include all products
include descriptive material in markdown
Exceptions:
application ontologies
ontologies that deliberately not OBO-esque
Register non OBOs with Bioportal + w3id
Use GitHub for .owl distribution unless ontology is large, then consider:
GitHub releases
S3
See Nico’s application ontology tutorial
Follow group exemplars: Uberon, Mondo, GO, ENVO, CL, PATO, BERO, PhenIO
but be aware each has their quirks
distribute useful products
distribute SSSOM
always distribute an .obo
always distribute a obo .json
distribute a kgx file (NEW)
distribute a rdftab/semsql sqlite file (NEW)
use a sensible source format (foo-edit.owl)
.obo is best for diffs but less expressive and gotchas for CURIEs
functional syntax is often preferred
for template-based ontologies, much of the source may be TSVs
enable zenodo syncing
Understand issues relating to git conflicts with ontologies
.obo as source mitigates some of these
See this thread
See this post
many issues have since been resolved but unfortunately some remain
Analysis/Paper-centric Repos
One repo per paper
Entire analysis must be reproducible via Makefile
All steps:
download
clean/pre-process
transform
training
evaluation
check with Chris before using snakemake/CWL/alternatives
Use TSVs as default
make pandas-friendly
use unix newline characters, not dos
use human readable but computationally friendly column headers
NO ALL CAPS
alphanumeric characters preferred
spaces or underscores as word separators OK, but underscores preferred for formal formats
csvkit is your friend
ALL TSVs MUST have data dictionaries
use LinkML (see above)
check in small-mid size data files (&#x3C;10m)
consider cogs if TSVs must be managed in google sheets
use JSON for complex data
use KGX for anything that should be modeled as a KG
use descriptive filenames
manage metadata in GitHub
enable zenodo syncing
use S3 for larger files
release files to Zenodo
Dockerize
Use Jupyter notebooks
Consider Manubot
Other recommended best practices

Development Environment Setup
Code Editors:
vscode
pycharm
get professional, we will pay
GitHub copilot can be purchased as well, and is an excellent addition to a pycharm environment.
Keyboard Shortcuts
Command palette: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P
Search for file in project: Cmd/Ctrl + P
Open integrated terminal in VSCode: Cmd/Ctrl + ~
Open settings page: Cmd/Ctrl + ,
Set up custom keymap bindings
Mac
Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts > +`
Type in the key combination you want to use and assign it to an action of your choice
For ex., Cmd/Ctrl + i as a shortcut for selecting the Python interpreter
Essentials
Git configuration
Set username: git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
Set password: git config --global user.email "<a href="/commons-dws-public/mailto:YOUR_EMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM">YOUR_EMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM</a>"
Workspace setup
Make sure you have correctly selected the Python interpreter
Save workspace in order to open a specific view of the project directory
File > Save Workspace As
File > Open Workspace From File

Google Analytics
Example GA 4 conversion and walkthrough info at <a href="https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbops/issues/28#issuecomment-1712154894">https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbops/issues/28#issuecomment-1712154894</a>
avoid manually authoring anything that can be derived from metadata
examplars: obofoundry.github.io, this site
use CC-BY 4.0 or the CC0 public domain declaration
Examplars:
LinkML splash page
Phenopackets splash page
Cell Ontology splash page
Documentation
See google guide on Writing inclusive documentation
Avoid ableist language
Avoid unnecessarily gendered language
Avoid unnecessarily violent language
all code, schemas, analyses, ontologies, MUST be documented
documentation is a love-letter to your future self
understand the Diataxis four-way distinction: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation
exemplar: OBOOK
exemplar: LinkML docs
google API documentation guide
have strategies to avoid staleness and documentation getting out of sync
use inline documentation
publish via appropriate framework (RTD for code, mkdocs for schema, etc)
follow appropriate style guide
use and test docstring in python
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html</a>
examples, examples, examples
fenced examples in markdown docs
example standalone scripts
example Jupyter notebooks
double up: unit tests can serve as examples and vice versa
See linkml-run-examples framework
Use existing templates
monarch-project-template for code-oriented projects
linkml cookiecutter for schema projects
ODK for ontology projects
kghub template for KG projects
use Markdown as default
RST for Sphinx/Code projects
Google docs acceptable for initial brainstorming
Don’t use Wikis (mediawiki, GitHub wiki)
Manage markdown docs as version control
publish as static site (RTD, mkdocs, etc)
Coding/Python
Python is the default language; use others as appropriate
javascript/typescript for client-side
don’t implement domain/business logic in js. use python + APIs
use typescript
generate typescript datamodels using linkml gen-typescript
Rust for speed
should always have PyO3 wrappers
follow semsimian GH actions for wheels
Scala for performance reasoners or anything requiring owlapi
Historically we used Java for anything requiring OWLAPI but being phased out
Why Python?
ubiquitous, cross-platform
good for scripting, interactive development
strong ecosystem of libraries for almost anything
Easy for developers to pick up
Most bioinformaticians know it
use for anything more than about 10 lines of Bash/Perl
use Python 3.8+
Ensure github actions tests 3.9, 3.11
Conform to the group style guide, or at least some style guide
pep-0008 for Python
use type annotations PEP484
google style guide
We are inspired by knocean/practices/python but differ in some places
We make use of OO as appropriate - just don’t go overboard like in java
Follow conventional variable naming
Example: <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/dev/abbr.html">https://docs.fast.ai/dev/abbr.html</a>
See the Working with Python Environments guide for details on installing Python versions and managing virtual environments.
All repos should use poetry
Set up this way: poetry new --src my-project-name
OR use linkml-ws new for schema-centric repos
follow standard layouts, with code in src/
Linting/formatting:
Use black and flake8 and ruff
Test Runners
To automate building and testing distributions in multiple Python versions
tox
DE FACTO: Github hosted runner via Github Actions
CLI development
click
Testing
unittest
DE FACTO: pytest
Test coverage
Coverage.py
codecov
document all public classes, methods, functions
Always Use type annotations
Always provide docstrings
ReST (reStructuredText) » numpy-style docstrings or google style » nothing
SOME standard is always better than none
Be sure to set up your IDE for automatic docstring generation
use flask/fastAPI for web apps
NEVER author OpenAPI directly; ALWAYS derive
we are exploring GraphQL frameworks like strawberry.rocks
use dataclasses or pydantic
for DAOs, ALWAYS derive from linkml
avoid authoring data models directly in python
list comprehensions » lambdas
use fstrings; never write java-style python
ALWAYS use typing
makes code more understandable
allows code completion in PyCharm etc
helps find bugs
use an IDE
PyCharm or VS is equally popular in the group
ETL/ingest
follow existing exemplar repos
Read Chris’ 10 simple rules for semantic ETL
use requests for URL calls
Always provide a CLI
separate CLI logic from core logic
Read CLIG guidelines
See also [Documenting command-line syntax ]<a href="https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax">https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax</a>) in google style guide
Python: use click
design for composability
provide shortforms for common options
Display help text when passed no options, the -h flag, or the –help flag
use de-facto standards
-i, --input
-o, --output
-h, --help
always use dashes as separators, NOT underscores
click will make corresponding python vars with underscores
Follow exemplars
ROBOT
SSSOM
OAK
linkml
Always write unittests for CLIs
see OAK for examples
Profiling:
cProfile and SnakeViz are useful for profiling Python code ```bash
Generate the profile results:
python -m cProfile -o output.prof my_program.py</p>
<p>View them:
pipx run snakeviz output.prof ```</p>

OBOOK - Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Organized Knowledge
Web APIs
Authoring
FastAPI » Flask
Seperate business logic from API code
this should be independently testable
Testing
use fastapi.testclient
follow GO exemplar
Accessing
Use python requests library (unless a higher level lib is available)
Do not construct URL strings yourself - use params instead
for non-trivial tasks consider building a reusable client library
use a client library if it already exists!
examplars: OAK bioportal implementation
when querying a sparql endpoint
sparqlfun > sparqlwrapper > requests > curl
if constructing sparql is necessary
use a query builder rather than string manipulation
Shell
Programming
bash/sh
Personal
Use ohmyz
Database Engines
Current preferred stack
sqlite or postgres (normalized/write)
solr (denormalized/read)
that’s it
BUT: use whatever is appropriate for the job
blazegraph/joseki for ttl
neo4j for KGs
Postgresql for SQL db server
never use non-open SQL db solutions
Some legacy apps may use MySQL but Pg is preferred
sqlite for lightweight tabular
mongo for docs
avoid vendor lock-in
use generic sparql 1.1 API vs triplestore specific APIs
solr for searchable / denormalized / analytics
always use golr patterns
read semantic columnar store patterns
always have a schema no matter what the task
always author in LinkML
translate to SQL schema, JSON-Schema, Solr schema etc
familiarize yourself with the tools to do this
SQL vs other DB engines
this is an evolving area
see Knocean SQL guide

Programming Libraries
Data science
this is a fast changing field so recommendations here are general/loose
generally prefer Python » R » other languages for data sciences
we frequently use tensorflow, scikitlearn, keras
scikit-learn
catboost, xgboost
pandas
TSV » CSV
parquet or sqlite for large files
use # for header comments
always have a data dictionary in LinkML
always be working in a github repo (see below)
notebooks:
seaborn for plotting
Use notebooks for:
generating figs for paper
exploration
NEVER use notebooks for
core logic (extract into separate lib with tests)
ETL
anything that should be run in a pipeline
all notebooks MUST be reproducible
check small files into github
reproducible Makefile or snakemake for obtaining other files
ideally test all notebooks via gh-actions
KGs
kgx
BMT
EnsmallenGraph, (Rust + Python bindings), fast graph ML
Embiggen graph ML (e.g. node2vec), and some other things like word2vec
NEAT is a Python wrapper for reproducible graph ML in a YAML-driven way
also exploring pykeen ampligraph
Follow FAIR in a meaningful way
data dictionaries with LinkML
follow identifier best practice
Ontologies
Read the OAK guide
Use OAK for everything
ontobio is deprecated for non-GO specific tasks
OWLAPI (JVM) – only where absolutely necessary
beware of using rdflib and RDF-level libraries for working with OWL files, too low level (and slow)
access Ubergraph through OAK
access semsql through OAK
obographviz (js)
never, ever use XML parsers to parse RDF/XML
don’t every write a new obo format parser
obographs json direct access sometimes OK
NER/NLP
Read Harry’s awesome caufieldjh/awesome-bioie list
fast changing but some tools to consider:
ontorunNER (which wraps OGER)
BERT for language models (experimental)
Note we are now wrapping more of this functionality in OAK
now subsumed by LLMs
join the monarch nlp slack channel
Shell commands
sh > subprocess
File formats, languages, and standards
General
TSVs for columnar data
always have a data dictionary (use LinkML)
make it pandas-friendly
meaningful column names
SSSOM is an exemplar
understand TidyData and Codd’s normal forms and when to use them
hand-author YAML over JSON (+ follow schema)
Use JSON-LD / YAML-LD as appropriate
understand JSON-LD contexts
get context for free with LinkML
Turtle for some purposes
RDF/XML as default for OWL
Ontologies
Use OAK to access everything
OWL
OBO JSON
consider obo format deprecated. Exception: easier to maintain edit file as obo for git diff/PR purposes
COB as upper ontology, but also pay attention to biolink
Always use official PURLs for downloads
the OBO page gives the list of products. E.g. obofoundry.org/ontology/pato
Mappings (ontology or otherwise)
SSSOM with skos predicates
Cookiecutters for starting a new project.
General-purpose projects using monarch-project-template
LinkML based projects using linkml-project-cookiecutter
Ontology Access Kit (oaklib) plugin projects using `oakx-plugin-cookiecutter
KGs
biolink
kgx » rdf* » rdf
make available as:
RDF dump
Neo4J dump
sparql endpoint (consider putting into larger endpoint and segregating with NGs)
neo4j endpoint
KGX dump
KGX summary stats
Schemas
everything must have a schema, including:
all TSVs should have data dictionary
JSON/YAML
KGs
OWL ontologies and OWL instance graphs
Understand basic concepts:
normalized vs de-normalized
identifiers and URIs
closed-world vs open-world
schema vs ontology
Always author schemas in linkml
derive alternate representations (e.g. json-schema)
JSON-schema for JSON-centric projects (never author, always derive from LinkML)
ShEx or SHACL for ontology-centric (try and derive from LinkML)
Don’t use kwalify any more
Always have a LinkML schema even when using:
python dicts
open-ended JSON/YAML
RDF
Neo4J
ad-hoc TSVs
Include mappings:
map to biolink
Versioning
Semantic Versioning (semver) by default
software MUST use semver
schemas SHOULD use semver, but OBO-style may sometimes be appropriate
ISO-8601 OBO style for OBO ontologies
use GitHub releases for versioning as appropriate
always use the autofill feature to make release notes and to name releases
for software follow the group github-action best practice to auto-release to pypi
release versions to appropriate repository/archive
Compression
use .gz instead of .zip
if compressing multiple files in an archive, use .tar.gz, not .zip
Rememeber compressed files are not diffable in git
For very large files consider distributing gz files via S3 or zenodo rather than in GitHub
remember: if a repo has 10 x 50m files that change every release, the repo will be 10g in size in 20 releases
As a general rule of thumb, think very carefully before committing files > 1m to github
exceptions for existing best practice e.g. odk
ask if unsure
Text
markdown by default
frontmatter metadata where appropriate
track in version control
use .rst for sphinx sites where autodoc features are needed
don’t use wikis or github wikis except where precedent is set
APIs
RESTfulness
true REST may be too high a barrier
RPC-style (i.e. swagger/openAPI) may be fine
All web APIs should have OpenAPI exploration interface
derive OpenAPI from Python code
fastapi > flask »> others
considering GraphQL
Must have Docker container
Deprecated: Use grlc or sparqlfun to make APIs from sparql endpoints
CURIEs and IRIs
Read McMurry et al.
Prefixmaps (a Python library for retrieving semantic prefix maps) is now our source of truth for all things prefix/namespace related
Take the time to read ALL docs on bioregistry.io
always use CURIEs for IDs
CURIEs + prefixmap » URIs »» ad-hoc
always use prefixes registered in bioregistry.io
understand at a broad level the different registries:
<a href="http://identifiers.org">http://identifiers.org</a>
<a href="http://n2t.net">http://n2t.net</a> – synced(?) with identifiers.org but broader context
<a href="http://bioregistry.io/">http://bioregistry.io/</a>
has a lot of advantages over id.org: more transparent, github metadata based, lightweight
<a href="https://github.com/prefixcommons/biocontext">https://github.com/prefixcommons/biocontext</a>
we developed this as an “overlay” on existing registries
have an explicit JSON-LD context or prefixes yaml file
Use the prefixcommons curie util library
Read the identifiers guides closely, even for projects you are not on
Translator SRI/biolink identifiers
Identifiers in NMDC
Identifiers in GO
Genomics
GFF3
SO
Annotation
GAF
GPAD
Phenopackets
Dates
use ISO-8601
use ISO-8601
use ISO-8601
use ISO-8601
never, ever write a date in non-ISO-8601
Portability
it should be easy for anyone to install from any of our repos
everything should run on macos or linux
provide a Docker image for anything complex
use standard installation idioms
Key specialized libraries and command line tools
OAK, for ontologies
kgx
ODK and ROBOT, for ontologies
ontorunNER for NER
Building Ontologies
ontologies are for users, not ontologists
OWL and description logic is necessary for building robust ontologies, but needn’t be exposed
Minimize philosophy
avoid unnecessary abstractions
ontologies should have annotations
annotations, as in the sense used by curators
ontologies without annotations are generally of limited use, avoid working on them
learn tools and best practice for robust ontology engineering
Read Onto-Tips
Use and understand ODK
Use ROBOT
Take the OBO Academy training
work on the components on your own
attend the Monarch tutorials
use the ontologies we work on as examplars
GO
Uberon
Mondo
Phenotype Ontologies
ENVO
RO
CL
follow OBO best practice and principles
ontologies should be open
if OBO is underspecified, follow the examples of projects done in this group
NEW: see ontology-metadata in OAK
oio » IAO
liberal axiom annotations
key annotation properties: synonyms, definitions, mappings
See documentation on uberon synonyms, this is an exemplar for us
Programmatic generation
linkml-owl
dosdp OR robot template
always use the more appropriate tool for the job
include comprehensive definitions clear to biologists
read definitions guide
understand compositional patterns
avoid overmodeling
Document ontologies
document design decisions
write clear operational definitions
document your design patterns
Watch design pattern presentation
DOSDP repo
Mondo is our exemplar
understand limitations
use ontologies only where appropriate
vocabularies
descriptors
don’t use an ontology where a schema is more appropriate
don’t use an ontology where a KG is more appropriate. See KG vs ontology DPs
make best effort attempt to provide mappings
use SSSOM
use boomer
use oak lexmatch
Collaboration
we are a collaborative group, reach out if you have issues
join relevant channels on bbop and other Slack workspaces
questions always welcome but make best effort to see if information available in group reference guides
don’t struggle alone!
others are likely to either have similar questions/frustrations to you, or will have faced them in the past
questions are always welcome but always check standard sources first
for programming questions, search Stack Overflow
for questions regarding group or collaborator tools, is it in the FAQ?
make it easy for people to help you
be concise, yet provide sufficient relevant context
make it actionable
Discouraged: X doesn’t work
Encouraged: when I do A, I get result B, but I expect C
create issues with concise, actionable titles
your problem should be reproducible as far as possible
ideally contribute a a test case following idioms of appropriate repo (learn how to do this)
make things easier for those who follow you
the same questions often come up repeatedly
if someone answers a question for you, update the relevant guide (FAQ etc) to make it clearer for others
upvote answers on Stack Overflow you find useful
give thumbs up to helpful comments
star repos you find useful
follow codes of conduct
be constructive in any criticism
use your Berkeley Lab account for email, calendars
keep your calendar up to date, this facilitates scheduling meetings
Slack
avoid <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@channel (Private)</a> unless necessary
discussion about tickets OK but decisions and key points must be recorded in ticket
use GitHub for requests
Use GitHub for requesting terms from ontologies etc
Data mapping guide: selecting and requesting terms from ontologies, data models, and standards
Google docs/slides/sheets hygiene
Read Julie’s awesome intro to Google Drive
Read [Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists](<a href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/">https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/</a> from datacarpentry
Read Data Organization in Spreadsheets by Bronan and Woo
be consistent
write dates like YYYY-MM-DD
put just one thing in a cell
no not merge cells
organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row)
create a data dictionary
do not include calculations in the raw data files
do not use font color or highlighting as data
choose good names for things
make backups
use data validation to avoid data entry errors
save the data in plain text files
Use google docs/slides over Microsoft/Apple/Desktop
but sometimes markdown+git is more appropriate than either
for grants, papers, and other collaborative documents, move to Word at last possible minute (if at all)
pandocs can be used to make markdown
avoid latex/beamer unless it is really called for
Use tagging/comments/modes appropriately
If it’s not your doc, default to Suggesting mode
use your judgment; minor direct edits to correct typos usually OK
respect conventions of document owner
use comment feature to make comments, don’t write your comment in a different color
avoid use of text color as semantics
assign/tag people appropriately
avoid comment wars
Make the doc outline-mode-friendly
use H1/H2/etc. for headers (don’t just style normal text)
always have outline mode on (list-like icon near top left)
assume the reader has outline mode on
rarely need for a TOC
For google sheets / excel
never manually color code or use font/strikethrough. Always add an explicit field and use conditional formatting
always have a schema, even if it is a flat data dictionary. linkml-model-enrichment will derived one
favour TSV+github over google sheets
workflows clearly favor sheets
when using sheets, use cogs
follow TSV guidelines for google sheets
Use formatted templates where appropriate (grants, papers)
Use Paperpile for citations / reference management (you have access via the Lab)
Give documents meaningful names (e.g., not just “meeting”)–assume that most people will find the doc via search rather than by going through the folder hierarchy
don’t use camelcase or underscores in google doc names, it hinders search
organize google docs in the relevant folder depending on what project is funding the work
understand how navigation works for google docs
make docs and folders viewable by all by default, unless sensitive
include links to slides of general relevance from project repos
reuse slides from existing slide decks, but provide attribution
Tips
search operators
Best practices for meetings
See Best practices for writing a good meeting reminder
Use a rolling agenda/notes doc, rather than one doc per meeting
most recent first
ISO-8601 » human readable dates » anything else
The auto <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@today (Private)</a> feature is useful
always have a google doc for every meeting you are in
record decisions
include a link to the rolling doc in calendar invites
include the Zoom / videoconference link in the rolling notes doc
DevOps

General Principles
DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself
but avoid over-abstraction and frameworkitis
various 10 simple guides:
10 simple rules of quick and dirty scientific programming
Always reuse
we probably have a Python library for it
reuse general design patterns
GitHub templates
follow exemplar repos
kgx and linkml for general python
kg-covid-19 for ETL
try especially hard not to reinvent what someone in the group or our collaborator has done
Avoid perfectionism
iterate on solutions
smaller batches of incremental progress » long delays on perfect solution (that may turn out to be flawed)
For many tasks, the 80/20 rule may suffice
Don’t boil the ocean
beware of rabbit holes

the the COMMONS Lab Open Dendron !\n\nIn the [COMMONS Lab](https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/groups/allard/) we intent to follow the [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) approach to document our research.\n\nFor this we use the [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) system as a mean to efficiently capture notes and publish them.\n\n## What is this note\n\nThis note is a succinct tutorial note aiming to get you started in the use of the COMMONS Lab Dendron.\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Dendron. \n\n#### What is Dendron ?\n\n\u003e Dendron is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool. Think of it as a cache for everything that you care about - if you've spent more then five minutes solving a problem, you should never spent any more time solving the same exact problem.\n\u003e \n\u003e Dendron is a knowledge base built by and for developers and integrates natively with IDEs like VS Code and VSCodium.\n\n#### Where to get more info on Dendron ?\n\n- You can get more information in the Dendron system at the official website www.dendron.so\n- All the Dendron documentation is hosted here https://wiki.dendron.so/. It is, obviously, a Dendron itself.\n\n#### Concrete steps to access and contribute to the DBGI Dendron\n\n1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\n2. Install [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) from the VSCode marketplace \n3. Clone the COMMONS Dendron repo\n\n    In your terminal\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/commons-research/commons-dws-public.git\n    ```\n4.
